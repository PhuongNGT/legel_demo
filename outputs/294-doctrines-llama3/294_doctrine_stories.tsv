concept	"A concept is an abstract idea that serves as a foundation for more concrete principles, thoughts, and beliefs.
Concepts play an important role in all aspects of cognition. As such, concepts are studied within such disciplines as linguistics, psychology, and philosophy, and these disciplines are interested in the logical and psychological structure of concepts, and how they are put together to form thoughts and sentences. The study of concepts has served as an important flagship of an emerging interdisciplinary approach, cognitive science.
In contemporary philosophy, three understandings of a concept prevail:

mental representations, such that a concept is an entity that exists in the mind (a mental object)
abilities peculiar to cognitive agents (mental states)
Fregean senses, abstract objects rather than a mental object or a mental state
Concepts are classified into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed ""superordinate"" and lower levels termed ""subordinate"". Additionally, there is the ""basic"" or ""middle"" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept. For example, a basic-level concept would be ""chair"", with its superordinate, ""furniture"", and its subordinate, ""easy chair"".
Concepts may be exact or inexact. When the mind makes a generalization such as the concept of tree, it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables higher-level thinking. A concept is instantiated (reified) by all of its actual or potential instances, whether these are things in the real world or other ideas.
Concepts are studied as components of human cognition in the cognitive science disciplines of linguistics, psychology, and philosophy, where an ongoing debate asks whether all cognition must occur through concepts. Concepts are regularly formalized in mathematics, computer science, databases and artificial intelligence. Examples of specific high-level conceptual classes in these fields include classes, schema or categories. In informal use, the word concept can refer to any idea."	"Meet Sarah, a marketing manager who loves cooking. She's always been fascinated by the art of combining different ingredients to create unique dishes. Sarah's friends often rave about her culinary skills, and she's even been asked to cater for a few events.

One day, Sarah realized that her favorite cooking style was a blend of Mediterranean, Italian, and Asian cuisines. She started to notice patterns and commonalities between these styles, such as the use of olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice. Sarah's mind created a mental representation of what she called ""flavor fusion,"" which became her go-to concept for cooking.

As she cooked more, Sarah refined her concept of flavor fusion, extracting specific elements from each cuisine to create her own signature dishes. She found herself thinking about flavor fusion as a mental state, effortlessly combining different flavors and textures to create something new and exciting.

Sarah's concept of flavor fusion became a superordinate concept, encompassing various subordinate concepts like Mediterranean, Italian, and Asian cuisines. When she thought about a specific dish, she could easily categorize it as flavor fusion, making it easier to come up with new creations.

Sarah's understanding of flavor fusion also evolved from a mental representation to a reified concept, as she began to share her creations with friends and family. Her concept was instantiated by all her actual dishes, and she saw how others responded to the blends of flavors she created.

Through her experience, Sarah came to understand that concepts are abstract ideas that help us make sense of the world. She realized that her concept of flavor fusion was not just a mental object, but a complex combination of mental states, thought patterns, and abstract objects that enabled her to create something unique and delicious."
Abatement ab initio	"Abatement ab initio (Latin for ""from the beginning"") is a common law legal doctrine that states that the death of a defendant who is appealing a criminal conviction extinguishes all criminal proceedings initiated against that defendant from indictment through conviction. Abatement ab initio was the subject of two United States Supreme Court decisions, Durham v. United States (1971) and Dove v. United States (1976). The former extended the doctrine to cases where certiorari was pending and not yet granted, and the latter excluded discretionary appeals."	"Tom, a small business owner, was accused of tax evasion and went on trial. He was found guilty and sentenced to serve 5 years in prison. However, Tom was not one to give up. He immediately filed an appeal, hoping to contest the conviction in a higher court.

As the appeal w"
Abstention doctrine	"An abstention doctrine is any of several doctrines that a United States court may (or in some cases must) apply to refuse to hear a case if hearing the case would potentially intrude upon the powers of another court. Such doctrines are usually invoked where lawsuits involving the same issues are brought in two different court systems at the same time (such as federal and state courts).
The United States has a federal court system with limitations on the cases that it can hear, while each state has its own individual court system. In some instances, the jurisdiction of these courts overlap, so a lawsuit between two parties may be brought in either or both courts. The latter circumstance can lead to confusion, waste resources, as well as cause the appearance that one court is disrespecting the other. Both federal and state courts have developed rules determining when one court will defer to another's jurisdiction over a particular case."	"The once-thriving small business, ""Main Street Deli,"" was at the center of a bitter dispute between its owner, Sarah, and a former employee, Tom. The issue was a contractual dispute over the terms of Tom's employment agreement. According to Sarah, Tom had signed an agreement allowing him to open a competing deli within a one-mile radius of Main Street Deli within three years of his departure. Tom, on the other hand, claimed the clause was unfair and unjustly restricted his entrepreneurial ambitions.

Tom filed a lawsuit against Sarah in federal court, alleging that the employment contract contained federal anti-competitive provisions. Meanwhile, Sarah countered by filing a state court lawsuit, claiming that the contract was a garden-variety employment agreement controlled by state laws.

As the cases progressed, both courts began to realize that they were hearing the same dispute. To avoid duplicative litigation and potential inconsistencies in the rulings, they decided to invoke the abstention doctrine. The federal court recognized that the state court was the more appropriate forum to resolve the dispute, as employment contracts fell under state jurisdiction. Therefore, the federal court would abstain from exercising its jurisdiction and allow the state court to hear the case.

The abstention doctrine prevented both courts from overstepping their jurisdictions, ensuring that the dispute was resolved efficiently and with proper application of the relevant laws. In the end, the state court issued a ruling that was binding on both parties, avoiding the confusion and waste of resources that could have resulted from simultaneous proceedings in both courts."
Abstraction principle (law)	The abstract system of title transfer (German: Abstraktionsprinzip) is a legal term in German law relating to the law of obligations (Schuldrecht) and property law (Sachenrecht). Although no express reference to it is made in the German Civil Code (BGB), the concept of separating a personal undertaking to pay or exchange goods or legal rights (e.g. through contract) from the conveyance of title to those goods or legal rights (e.g. through a deed or land registration) is fundamental to German private law (as well as Brazilian law, Greek law, South African law, and Scots law).	"Meet Emma, a young entrepreneur who owns a small bakery. She decides to expand her business by partnering with her friend, Alex, to open a new store in a popular shopping district. They agree to split the profits 50/50 and create a joint venture.

To formalize their partnership, they sign a partnership agreement, which outlines their roles, responsibilities, and profit sharing. However, the agreement does not transfer the title to the new store. The deed to the property remains with Emma, as she is the one who purchased it.

Six months later, Alex wants to withdraw from the partnership. Emma, feeling frustrated, tries to force Alex to sell their share of the business. But Alex refuses, claiming that they never intended to transfer their share of the profit stream.

Here's where the abstraction principle kicks in. Even though Emma owns the deed, she cannot force Alex to relinquish their claim to the profits. The abstraction principle separates the transfer of title (the deed) from the personal undertaking to perform certain obligations (the partnership agreement). This means that Alex's agreement to share profits is a separate entity from the property itself.

In this scenario, Emma can choose to buy out Alex's share of the business or find a new partner, but she cannot force Alex to give up their claim to the profits. The abstraction principle ensures that the legal relationship between parties is separated from the physical property, allowing for flexibility and clarity in complex transactions."
Acquiescence	"In law, acquiescence occurs when a person knowingly stands by, without raising any objection to, the infringement of their rights, while someone else unknowingly and without malice aforethought acts in a manner inconsistent with their rights. As a result of acquiescence, the person whose rights are infringed may lose the ability to make a legal claim against the infringer, or may be unable to obtain an injunction against continued infringement. The doctrine infers a form of ""permission"" that results from silence or passiveness over an extended period of time."	"The small town of Willow Creek was known for its weekly farmers' market, where local vendors sold fresh produce, baked goods, and handmade crafts. For years, Sarah had run a popular stall selling artisanal jams and preserves. She was known for her unique flavors and commitment to using only the freshest ingredients.

One day, a new vendor, Michael, set up a stall beside Sarah's, selling a similar range of jams and preserves. While the quality was not as high as Sarah's, the prices were significantly lower. At first, Sarah was concerned about the competition, but she didn't say anything, figuring that the market was big enough for both of them.

As weeks went by, Sarah noticed that Michael was copying her recipes, packaging, and even her brand name. At first, she thought it was a coincidence, but as she saw her sales decline, she realized Michael was intentionally trying to poach her customers.

Despite feeling upset and betrayed, Sarah remained silent. She figured that if she didn't make a fuss, she could keep her customers and maybe even benefit from the extra competition. But as the months passed and Michael continued to steal her ideas, Sarah began to lose her loyal customer base.

When Sarah finally decided to take action, she was told by the court that her silence and inaction had, in effect, granted Michael permission to use her intellectual property. Her claims for copyright infringement were dismissed, and she was forced to watch as Michael built a successful business on the back of her ideas."
Act of state doctrine	"The act-of-state doctrine is a principle in international law whereby acts done by a state in its own territory cannot be challenged by the national courts of another state.
As a principle of federal common law in the United States which states, in circumstances where it applies, that courts in the United States will not rule on the validity of another government's (formal) sovereign act with respect to property located within the latter's own territory. The act-of-state doctrine enters consideration most often in cases where a foreign sovereign has expropriated the property of a U.S. national located in that foreign territory (e.g. through nationalization)."	"Here's a short story that illustrates the act-of-state doctrine:

Maria, a U.S. citizen, owned a small business in a popular tourist town on the French Riviera. Two years ago, the French government, citing economic development concerns, decided to rezone the area and purchased Maria's property at a fair market value. The government planned to demolish the existing buildings and construct a new economic zone.

Maria was Notam Scana, a local French lawyer, and negotiated with the government to receive a fair market price for the property, which was tens of thousands of euros. However, Maria was unhappy with the deal and challenged the government's actions, claiming that the expropriation was not done fairly and that she should receive more compensation.

Maria brought the lawsuit to the French courts, but they ruled in favor of the government, citing that expropriation was within their sovereign powers. Maria then tried to bring the case to the U.S. courts, claiming that the French government's actions were ordered by its president, who was a personal friend of the U.S. President. However, the U.S. court dismissed the case, citing the act-of-state doctrine.

The court ruled that, as the expropriation took place within French territory, it was an internal matter of the French government and not a suitable subject for U.S. judicial intervention. Maria was left with no choice but to accept the French court's decision and move on with her life.

This story demonstrates how the act-of-state doctrine works: although Maria may have been deprived of her property, she cannot challenge the French government's actions in U.S. courts, as the expropriation took place within French territory and was an internal matter of the French government."
Actio libera in causa	"Actio libera in causa (frequently abbreviated as a.l.i.c., Latin for ""action free in its cause"") is a law principle in a typical Western law system (both common law and civil law). The doctrine means that even if the person was not free to choose the course of action while performing an offence, he can still be held responsible for it if he voluntarily created a condition (""cause"") for the offending action. A typical example is self-defense: in Anglo-American jurisdictions lethal action is justified under certain circumstances while protecting oneself, others, or property. However, this defense is not available, for example, to a person who started the fight, thus creating a ""cause"" for killing in self-defense at a later time. Most frequently a.l.i.c. is mentioned with regard to voluntary intoxication: if a person gets drunk, she will not be able use her state of inebriation to claim that, for example, her act of negligence was an accident."	"Here's a short story illustrating the legal concept of ""Actio libera in causa"":

Meet Alex, a college student who got in a fight at a party with his friend, Jamie. Alex had been drinking heavily throughout the night, and things escalated quickly. During the altercation, Jamie threw a punch that landed on Alex's face, causing him to stumble backward and accidentally knock over a nearby lamp. The lamp broke, and Alex, in a haze of angry frustration, grabbed a nearby bottle of whiskey and shattered it on the floor.

When the police arrived, they found Jamie lying on the ground, bleeding from a cut on his forehead. Alex was arrested and charged with criminal damage to property and assault.

At his trial, Alex's defense attorney argued that his client was an accident victim, driven by the drunk state he was in when Jamie initiated the fight. The prosecution, however, countered that Alex created the condition (causing his intoxication) that led to his actions. The court agreed, ruling that Alex was aware of the danger of drinking heavily before the fight, but chose to do so anyway.

The jury convicted Alex, finding that he was not innocent due to his inebriation, but rather chose to create a situation (getting drunk) that led to his reckless behavior. Alex could have avoided the whole situation by not drinking so much, or by not starting the fight with Jamie. Since he voluntarily put himself in that state, he could not claim that his later actions were just an accident. Alex was held responsible for his actions, illustrating the legal principle of actio libera in causa: even if the person was not free to choose the course of action while performing the offence, they can still be held responsible if they voluntarily created the condition that led to the offending action."
Administration of justice	The administration of justice is the process by which the legal system of a government is executed. The presumed goal of such an administration is to provide justice for all those accessing the legal system.	"Alex, a freelance writer, had been working on a project for months when her ex-partner, a prominent businessman, suddenly pulled out of their agreement and accused her of stealing his ideas. The dispute made headlines, and Alex's reputation began to suffer.

Panicked, Alex sought the help of a lawyer, Rachel, who specialized in intellectual property disputes. Rachel listened attentively to Alex's story, gathered evidence, and discovered that Alex's ex-partner was attempting to discredit her to avoid liability.

Rachel confidently represented Alex in court, presenting the evidence and expert testimony that proved Alex's innocence. The judge, Mr. Thompson, was fair and experienced, taking the time to carefully review each piece of evidence and question each witness.

After a thorough trial, the judge pronounced his verdict: Alex was not guilty of intellectual property theft. The court also ordered Alex's ex-partner to pay compensation for the harm caused to her reputation.

Thanks to the administration of justice, Alex's dignity and reputation were restored. She returned to her work with renewed confidence, knowing that the legal system had vindicated her. The court's neutrality, fairness, and due process ensured that justice was served, placing the emphasis on the facts rather than personal vendettas.

In this fictional scenario, the administration of justice is exemplified through the fair and impartial handling of Alex's case by the lawyer, judge, and court. The legal system's execution of justice served to provide justice for Alex, protecting her rights and reputation from harm."
Agent of record	"An agent of record (AOR) is an individual or legal entity with a duly executed contractual agreement with an insurance policy owner in line with the prevailing legal norms and regulations of the region in which the contract was entered. The agent of record has a legal right to receive commissions from the respective insurance policy.
The agent of record is authorized to represent an insured party in purchasing, servicing, and maintaining insurance coverage with a designated insurer. The majority of insurance companies will not disclose information or discuss an insured party's account with an agent other than the agent of record. An insured party wishing to change its insurance agent must properly authorize the insurer to release their information and discuss their coverage with their newly appointed agent, for example with an agent of record letter.
Relevant documents may be executed via hard copy or electronically (in jurisdictions where electronic execution is legal). Applications may be made electronically, as well as in physical form."	"Meet Sarah, a successful business owner in her late 30s. She had purchased a commercial insurance policy from XYZ Insurance Company three years ago through an agent named Alex, who was an independent broker. At the time, Sarah and Alex had signed a contract, making Alex the agent of record for her policy.

As Sarah's business grew, she decided to expand her operations and hire an in-house insurance manager, Rachel, to handle the policy. Rachel was not affiliated with XYZ Insurance Company, but she had experience working with insurance policies. Sarah wanted Rachel to take over the policy, but first, she needed to authorize XYZ Insurance to release the information and discuss the coverage with Rachel.

Sarah and Rachel drafted a letter, formally appointing Rachel as the new agent of record. The letter specified that Rachel would be authorized to receive commissions from XYZ Insurance and had the power to make changes to the policy. Once the letter was signed and sent to XYZ Insurance, Rachel was officially recognized as Sarah's new agent of record.

With Rachel as the agent of record, Sarah and her team were able to make informed decisions about their policy with confidence, knowing that XYZ Insurance would share necessary information and communication with Rachel. The change allowed Sarah to focus on her business growth, while Rachel handled the insurance aspects, ensuring that their interests were protected."
Aggregate effects doctrine	"The Aggregate effects doctrine, Cumulative effects doctrine, or substantial effects doctrine is a legal doctrine in United States federal law. The AED permits extension of the regulation of interstate commerce into any action which affects interstate commerce only when aggregated with other actions. It is most often associated with Wickard v. Filburn (1942).: 125  In Wickard a wheat farmer growing wheat solely for animal feed within the confines of his own farm was found to be regulatable because private growth for private consumption was the primary reason for decrease of demand.: 125 
Although mostly associated with Wickard, it is also referred to as ""substantial effects"" in another formative case the preceding year called U.S. v. Darby Lumber Co. (1941).: 126  In the previous term the same idea was the reasoning for the decision of  National Labor Relations Board v. Fainblatt . In Fainblatt the ""plenary"" power of interstate regulation ""extends to all such commerce be it great or small"" and had never been held ""to be constitutionally restricted because in any particular case the volume of the commerce affected may be small.""
Since its introduction this doctrine has been applied widely. One common example is alcohol laws, such as Michigan's well known wine shipment restrictions;  it is the basis of the influential NFIB v. Sebelius (2012) and some experts apply aggregate effects to the abortion law debate.
This doctrine is differently applied in tax and other cases and its effects upon firm decisions to enter or not enter interstate markets remains unclear."	"Here's a story that illustrates the Aggregate Effects doctrine:

Meet Sarah, a small-town baker in rural Ohio. She owns a cozy pastry shop, where she sells homemade bread, cakes, and cookies to her local customers. She grows her own wheat on a small plot of land near her shop to supplement her ingredients and reduce her costs. She bakes and sells her goods exclusively within Ohio, never exporting or shipping her products interstate.

One day, the federal government imposes a regulation requiring all wheat growers to plant a certain percentage of their land with drought-resistant seeds to mitigate the effects of climate change. Sarah is initially exempt from this regulation because she's not participating in interstate commerce. However, the government takes into account other wheat farmers across the country who are growing wheat not just for local consumption, but also for export. Since many of these farmers are adopting drought-resistant seeds, the collective impact of their actions is significantly reducing the country's carbon footprint.

The government argues that even if Sarah's wheat-growing activities don't have a significant direct impact on interstate commerce, the cumulative effects of all wheat farmers – including those who sell their produce nationally and internationally – create a substantial impact on the national commercial market. Therefore, the government asserts its authority to regulate Sarah's wheat-growing activities as well, citing the Aggregate Effects doctrine.

Sarah can be seen as the example where if she is producing according to local breed which on its own does not impact the interstate then the USDA could has right to direct her under the commerce clause because many farmers make locally influenced the counterparts around the country make proceed a representation that she could include in their inventory and quality of products is exactly due federal treated like little Cousin comprehensively universally treated directly regulated"
Alternative liability	Alternative liability is a legal doctrine that allows a plaintiff to shift the burden of proving causation of their injury to multiple defendants, even though only one of them could have been responsible. The leading case showing the principle of alternative liability in action is Summers v. Tice, where the two defendants negligently shot in the direction of the plaintiff and two pellets caused the plaintiff's injury, one in the right eye and one in the upper lip. In the interests of justice, the innocent plaintiff's case is not defeated because they cannot prove which party was the actual cause (but-for cause) of their injury.	"Here's a short story that illustrates the concept of alternative liability:

Rachel was at a summer camp along with her friends when a group of teenagers decided to play with guns, thinking they were BB guns. Unbeknownst to them, they were actually loaded with real pellets. During the game, two of the teens, Jake and Alex, aimed their guns in Rachel's direction. As they fired, Rachel felt a sharp pain in her left eye and another in her upper lip.

After the incident, Rachel sought medical attention and learned that she had suffered serious injuries. The pellets from both Jake's and Alex's guns had caused the harm. The police were called, and Jake and Alex were questioned. However, neither of them could recall which pellet caused which injury. Rachel was devastated and frustrated, unsure of how to prove which of the two teens was responsible for her injuries.

This is where the doctrine of alternative liability comes into play. Since both Jake and Alex had the capability to cause Rachel's injuries, the court ruled that Rachel didn't need to prove which one specifically caused her harm. The burden of proof shifted to Jake and Alex, and they were both held liable for Rachel's injuries. The court's decision was based on the principle of justice, which held that it would be unfair to allow either Jake or Alex to escape responsibility due to the uncertainty surrounding the origin of the pellets.

As a result, Rachel's injuries were compensated through the settlement, and both Jake and Alex learned a valuable lesson about the importance of being responsible with firearms."
Assignment of income doctrine	"The assignment of income doctrine is a judicial doctrine developed in United States case law by courts trying to limit tax evasion.  The assignment of income doctrine seeks to ""preserve the progressive rate structure of the Code by prohibiting the splitting of income among taxable entities."""	"Meet Emily, a successful freelance graphic designer. She receives a stimulus package worth $100,000 from the government to help small businesses recover from the pandemic. However, Emily doesn't really need the money and decides to gift most of it to her three children, who are all currently in college.

Emily's plan is to transfer the funds to each child's individual bank account, thinking that this way, she can avoid paying taxes on the entire amount. She figures that since each child only receives a small portion of the stimulus package, she'll avoid paying a higher tax rate on the entire amount.

However, the IRS doesn't see it that way. They argue that Emily is attempting to split her income among her children to avoid paying higher taxes. The court agrees, applying the assignment of income doctrine. The judge rules that the stimulus package is Emily's income, regardless of who she gifts it to. The court orders Emily to report the entire amount as her income and pay the corresponding taxes.

The assignment of income doctrine prevents individuals from circumventing the progressive tax rate structure by splitting their income among family members or other entities. In this case, the court ruled that Emily cannot evade paying taxes by gifting her stimulus package to her children. The doctrine ensures that income is reported and taxed based on the individual's true economic position, rather than artificially dividing it among multiple parties to avoid taxes."
Assumption of risk	Assumption of risk is a defense, specifically an affirmative defense, in the law of torts, which bars or reduces a plaintiff's right to recovery against a negligent tortfeasor if the defendant can demonstrate that the plaintiff voluntarily and knowingly assumed the risks at issue inherent to the dangerous activity in which the plaintiff was participating at the time of their injury.	"Alex had always been an adventurous soul, so when she signed up for a skydiving experience on her birthday, she was thrilled. The company, SkyHigh, promised a safe and exhilarating experience, but Alex knew that skydiving was inherently risky.

Before jumping out of the plane, the instructor, Mike, warned Alex about the dangers of skydiving, including the potential for gear failure and equipment malfunction. Alex listened attentively, acknowledging that these risks were an inherent part of the activity.

Despite the warnings, Alex still felt a rush of excitement as she took the leap of faith. And yet, just as they were descending back to earth, the main parachute failed to deploy, sending Alex plummeting towards the ground.

As Alex suffered a serious injury, she couldn't help but think that SkyHigh and Mike were at fault for her predicament. However, when she brought a lawsuit against them, the defense team presented evidence that Alex had signed a waiver acknowledging the risks of skydiving and had been warned about the potential dangers before jumping.

The judge ruled in favor of SkyHigh and Mike, citing Alex's assumption of risk. The court held that by knowingly and voluntarily participating in the activity, Alex had assumed the risk of injury and therefore could not recover damages from the defendants.

Alex was disappointed, but ultimately understanding. She had, after all, made the conscious decision to take part in an activity that carried inherent risks. In the end, Alex realized that she had been complicit in her own risk-taking, and the court's decision was a reminder of the importance of informed consent and personal responsibility."
Assured clear distance ahead	"In legal terminology, the assured clear distance ahead (ACDA) is the distance ahead of any terrestrial locomotive device such as a land vehicle, typically an automobile, or watercraft, within which they should be able to bring the device to a halt. It is one of the most fundamental principles governing ordinary care and the duty of care for all methods of conveyance, and is frequently used to determine if a driver is in proper control and is a nearly universally implicit consideration in vehicular accident liability. The rule is a precautionary trivial burden required to avert the great probable gravity of precious life loss and momentous damage. Satisfying the ACDA rule is necessary but not sufficient to comply with the more generalized basic speed law, and accordingly, it may be used as both a layman's criterion and judicial test for courts to use in determining if a particular speed is negligent, but not to prove it is safe. As a spatial standard of care, it also serves as required explicit and fair notice of prohibited conduct so unsafe speed laws are not void for vagueness. The concept has transcended into accident reconstruction and engineering.
This distance is typically both determined and constrained by the proximate edge of clear visibility, but it may be attenuated to a margin of which beyond hazards may reasonably be expected to spontaneously appear. The rule is the specific spatial case of the common law basic speed rule, and an application of volenti non fit injuria. The two-second rule may be the limiting factor governing the ACDA, when the speed of forward traffic is what limits the basic safe speed, and a primary hazard of collision could result from following any closer.
As the original common law driving rule preceding statutized traffic law, it is an ever important foundational rule in today's complex driving environment. Because there are now protected classes of roadway users—such as a school bus, mail carrier, emergency vehicle, horse-drawn vehicle, agricultural machinery, street sweeper, disabled vehicle, cyclist, and pedestrian—as well as natural hazards which may occupy or obstruct the roadway beyond the edge of visibility, negligence may not depend ex post facto on what a driver happened to hit, could not have known, but had a concurrent duty to avoid. Furthermore, modern knowledge of human factors has revealed physiological limitations—such as the subtended angular velocity detection threshold (SAVT)—which may make it difficult, and in some circumstance impossible, for other drivers to always comply with right-of-way statutes by staying clear of roadway.

"	"It was a sunny Saturday morning, and Sarah was driving on a rural road, headed to a friend's house for a BBQ. As she approached a bend, she noticed a large truck was already negotiating the curve, partially blocking her view. She slowed down, keeping a safe distance, as she knew it was essential to maintain a assured clear distance ahead (ACDA).

As she cleared the bend, Sarah spotted a herd of sheep crossing the road ahead. She pressed the brakes, easily coming to a stop within the distance she had maintained from the truck. A few minutes later, a horse-drawn buggy came into view, slowing down and stopping just ahead of her.

Sarah breathed a sigh of relief, feeling confident that she had left sufficient space to react to any unexpected situation. She realized that maintaining a safe distance meant more than just following the speed limit – it involved anticipating potential hazards and having enough space to stop or react if needed.

As she continued her drive, Sarah thought about how the ACDA concept applied not only to her own driving but also to other road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists, and emergency vehicles. She understood that it was a common-sense rule that every driver should follow, especially when encountering shared roadways or unexpected obstacles.

As she arrived at her friend's house, Sarah felt grateful for the reminder to prioritize her safety and the safety of others on the road. She knew that by maintaining a safe distance, she was not only protecting herself but also respecting the rights and well-being of all other road users."
Attractive nuisance doctrine	"The attractive nuisance doctrine applies to the law of torts in some jurisdictions. It states that a landowner may be held liable for injuries to children trespassing on the land if the injury is caused by an object on the land that is likely to attract children.  The doctrine is designed to protect children who are unable to appreciate the risk posed by the object, by imposing a liability on the landowner. The doctrine has been applied to hold landowners liable for injuries caused by abandoned cars, piles of lumber or sand, trampolines, and swimming pools. However, it can be applied to virtually anything on the property.
There is no set cutoff point that defines youth. The courts will evaluate each ""child"" on a case-by-case basis to see if the ""child"" qualifies as a youth. If it is determined that the child was able to understand and appreciate the hazard, the doctrine of attractive nuisance will not likely apply.
Under the old common law, the plaintiff (either the child, or a parent suing on the child's behalf) had to show that it was the hazardous condition itself which lured the child onto the landowner's property. However, most jurisdictions have statutorily altered this condition, and now require only that the injury was foreseeable by the landowner."	"Here's a story illustrating the attractive nuisance doctrine:

It's a sunny Saturday afternoon, and 7-year-old Timmy is exploring the neighborhood. He spots a small trampoline that's been left set up in his friend's neighbor's yard. The property owner, Mr. Johnson, had recently moved out of the house and left the trampoline behind. Timmy, being a curious kid, loves jumping and has never been warned about this abandoned trampoline.

As he climbs up onto the trampoline, he fails to notice a loose spring underneath. As he starts bouncing, the spring gives way, and Timmy falls to the ground, landing awkwardly on his ankle. He screams in pain and falls, crying.

The hospital diagnoses Timmy with a broken ankle and informs his parents that he might need surgery. His parents sue Mr. Johnson, claiming that the trampoline was an attractive nuisance, as it was likely to attract children and posed a significant risk to them.

The court agrees that the trampoline fits the definition of an attractive nuisance. Although Timmy had been trespassing on the property, the court rules that Mr. Johnson is liable for his injuries. The court recognizes that children under 10 are unlikely to fully understand the hazards of playing on a trampoline without adult supervision, especially one that's not properly secured.

As a result, Mr. Johnson is held responsible for not only taking his trampoline down but also for contributing to the emotional trauma inflicted on Timmy and his family."
Attribution (law)	"Doctrines of attribution are legal doctrines by which liability is extended to a defendant who did not actually commit the criminal act.: 347  : 665  Examples include vicarious liability (when acts of another are imputed or ""attributed"" to a defendant), attempt to commit a crime (even though it was never completed), and conspiracy to commit a crime (when it is not completed or which is committed by another in the conspiracy).: 665 "	"Meet Sarah, a CEO of a small retail company. One of her employees, Alex, was responsible for restocking shelves and handling customer complaints. One evening, Alex attended a training session conducted by a regional manager, who emphasized the importance of high-quality customer service. The next day, Alex got into an argument with a dissatisfied customer, and in a fit of rage, threw a product at the customer, causing injury.

Sarah was notified about the incident, but she didn't personally witness it. She feared that her company's reputation would suffer if the incident went to court. An investigation revealed that Alex had indeed acted alone, and he was fired immediately.

However, Sarah's lawyers informed her that, under the doctrine of attribution, the company could still be held liable. Since Alex was an employee acting within the scope of his employment, his actions could be attributed to the company. The court ruled that the company was vicariously liable for Alex's actions, as he was acting as the company's agent.

Sarah was shocked, but she realized that it was a necessary consequence of having employees who worked on behalf of her company. The judgment led to a settlement, and Sarah vowed to implement stricter policies and training programs to prevent similar incidents in the future.

This scenario illustrates the concept of attribution, where liability is extended to Sarah's company, despite Alex's individual actions. The doctrine recognizes that employers can be accountable for the actions of their employees, whether intentional or not, and it provides a legal framework for holding them accountable."
Audi alteram partem	"Audi alteram partem (or audiatur et altera pars) is a Latin phrase meaning ""listen to the other side"", or ""let the other side be heard as well"". It is the principle that no person should be judged without a fair hearing in which each party is given the opportunity to respond to the evidence against them.
""Audi alteram partem"" is considered to be a principle of fundamental justice or equity or the principle of natural justice in most legal systems. This principle includes the rights of a party or its lawyers to confront the witnesses against them, to have a fair opportunity to challenge the evidence presented by the other party, to summon one's own witnesses and to present evidence, and to have counsel, if necessary at public expense, in order to make one's case properly."	"Meet Emma, a talented pastry chef who owned a small bakery in a bustling city. One morning, a customer, Alex, came in and claimed that Emma's famous chocolate cake was spoiled and made him sick. Alex demanded a full refund and threatened to take her to court if she didn't comply.

The city authorities took his complaint seriously and issued an emergency closure notice to Emma's bakery, citing the alleged food poisoning incident. Emma was devastated. She knew she had made the cake fresh that morning and had taken extreme care to ensure its quality.

Determined to clear her name, Emma hired a lawyer and requested a hearing to present her side of the story. She argued that Alex had a history of suing businesses and making false claims, and that the alleged incident was merely a coincidence. She also presented testimony from her customers and employees, who attested to her impeccable reputation and high-quality baking practices.

The hearing was held, and the city authorities listened carefully to Emma's defense. They also summoned Alex to testify and confronted him with evidence of his previous lawsuits and inconsistencies in his story. In the end, the authorities were convinced of Emma's innocence and lifted the closure notice, allowing her to reopen her bakery.

The court recognized that Emma had been given a fair hearing, and her right to confront the evidence against her and present her own evidence had been respected. This was a classic example of ""audi alteram partem"" in action – the principle that each party should have a fair opportunity to be heard, and that justice should not be predetermined by unilateral claims or accusations."
Basic structure doctrine	"The basic structure doctrine is a common law legal doctrine that the constitution of a sovereign state has certain characteristics that cannot be erased by its legislature. The doctrine is recognised in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and  Uganda. It was developed by the Supreme Court of India in a series of constitutional law cases in the 1960s and 1970s that culminated in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, where the doctrine was formally adopted. Bangladesh is perhaps the only legal system in the world that recognizes this doctrine in an expressed, written and rigid constitutional manner through Article 7B of its Constitution.
In Kesavananda Bharati, Justice Hans Raj Khanna propounded that the Constitution of India contains certain basic features that cannot be altered or destroyed through amendments by the Parliament of India. Key among these ""basic features"", as expounded by Justice Khanna, are the fundamental rights guaranteed to individuals by the constitution. The doctrine thus forms the basis of the Supreme Court of India's power to review and strike down constitutional amendments and acts enacted by the Parliament that conflict with or seek to alter this ""basic structure"" of the Constitution. The basic features of the Constitution have not been explicitly defined by the Judiciary, and the determination of any particular feature as a ""basic"" feature is made by the Court on a case-by-case basis.
The Supreme Court's initial position on constitutional amendments had been that any part of the Constitution was amendable and that the Parliament might, by passing a Constitution Amendment Act in compliance with the requirements of article 368, amend any provision of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights and article 368.
In 1967, the Supreme Court reversed its earlier decisions in Golaknath v. State of Punjab. It held that Fundamental Rights included in Part III of the Constitution are given a ""transcendental position"" and are beyond the reach of Parliament. It also declared any amendment that ""takes away or abridges"" a Fundamental Right conferred by Part III as unconstitutional. In 1973, the basic structure doctrine was formally introduced with rigorous legal reasoning in Justice Hans Raj Khanna's decisive judgment in the landmark decision of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala. Previously, the Supreme Court had held that the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution was unfettered. However, in this landmark ruling, the Court adjudicated that while Parliament has ""wide"" powers, it did not have the power to destroy or emasculate the basic elements or fundamental features of the constitution.
Although Kesavananda was decided by a narrow margin of 7–6, the basic structure doctrine, as propounded in Justice Khanna's judgement, has since gained widespread legal and scholarly acceptance due to a number of subsequent cases and judgments relying heavily upon it to strike down Parliamentary amendments that were held to be violative of the basic structure and therefore unconstitutional. Primary among these was the imposition of a state of emergency by Indira Gandhi in 1975, and her subsequent attempt to suppress her prosecution through the 39th Amendment. When the Kesavananda case was decided, the underlying apprehension of the majority bench that elected representatives could not be trusted to act responsibly was perceived as unprecedented. However, the passage of the 39th Amendment by the Indian National Congress' majority in central and state legislatures, proved that in fact such apprehension was well-grounded. In Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain and Minerva Mills v. Union of India, Constitution Benches of the Supreme Court used the basic structure doctrine to strike down the 39th Amendment and parts of the 42nd Amendment respectively, and paved the way for restoration of Indian democracy.
The Supreme Court's position on constitutional amendments laid out in its judgements is that Parliament can amend the Constitution but cannot destroy its ""basic structure"".
The basic structure doctrine was rejected by the High Court of Singapore. It was initially also rejected by the Federal Court of Malaysia, but was later accepted by it. Conversely, the doctrine was initially approved in Belize by the Supreme Court but was later reversed on appeal by the Belize Court of Appeal."	"Meet Rohan, a passionate Indian citizen who loves his country's unique blend of ancient traditions and modern democracy. He's deeply concerned about the increasingly authoritarian tendencies of the ruling government, which is trying to alter the constitution to suit its own agenda.

Under the existing law, the government can amend the constitution with a simple majority vote in both houses of parliament. However, Rohan believes that the amendments would compromise the country's democratic values and basic freedoms. He files a petition in the Supreme Court, arguing that certain fundamental features of the constitution, such as the protection of individual rights and the separation of powers, are essential to the country's identity and cannot be wiped out by the government.

The Supreme Court, after careful consideration, agrees with Rohan's contention. In a landmark judgment, it rules that the government cannot alter the constitution's basic structure, which includes the fundamental rights and separation of powers. The court affirms that while the government has the power to amend the constitution, it cannot destroy the very fabric of the country's democracy.

Rohan's victory is seen as a major setback for the government, which had hoped to use its majority to amend the constitution at will. The judgment sends a strong message to future governments, reminding them that the basic structure of the constitution is sacrosanct and must be respected. Rohan's battle has ensured that the country's democracy remains robust and resilient, protecting the rights of its citizens for generations to come."
Beneficium inventarii	"Beneficium inventarii (literally benefit of the inventory) is a legal doctrine introduced into Roman law by Justinian I to limit the liability of heirs resulting from an insolvent estate.
The beneficium inventarii (French: bénéfice d'invenataire) also occurred in article 793 of the Napoleonic Code (1804), which became the basis of most of the following civil codes, in force in countries such as France and Italy.
The doctrine, which is in force today in many civil law systems, applies to both wills and intestate successions. An heir may accept a succession under beneficium inventarii without being liable for the debts attaching to the estate or to the claims of legatees beyond the estate's value as previously determined by inventory."	"Meet Bruno, a 55-year-old widower living in a beautiful lakeside mansion inherited from his parents. Bruno's wife, Maria, had passed away recently, and their two adult children, Luca and Sofia, are still grieving. The mansion, which was a family business for generations, is heavily mortgaged, and the estate's value is significantly lower than the outstanding debts.

Bruno is faced with a daunting prospect: should he accept the inheritance and risk being liable for the debts, or should he decline the inheritance and potentially deprive his children of the family legacy? Upon seeking advice from his lawyer, Bruno learns about the beneficium inventarii doctrine.

According to this doctrine, Bruno can accept the inheritance without being responsible for the debts exceeding the estate's value as determined by the inventory. This means that he can inherit the mansion, but only to the extent of its current value, without being held personally liable for the remaining debts.

Bruno decides to accept the inheritance under beneficium inventarii, knowing that he will not be responsible for the additional debt. This allows him to maintain the family legacy and provide for his children while minimizing their financial burdens.

In this scenario, the beneficium inventarii doctrine provides a lifeline for Bruno, allowing him to navigate the complexities of inheritance and insolvency while protecting his own financial well-being. This legal concept ensures that heirs are not unfairly burdened by debts exceeding the estate's value, giving them the flexibility to make informed decisions about their inheritance."

"The story of Pierre and Colette:

Pierre, a successful businessman, passed away leaving behind a significant amount of debt. His wife Colette was nowhere near rich, but she was the sole beneficiary of Pierre's estate. As the executor of the estate, she was faced with a daunting task: to settle Pierre's debts.

Initially, Colette was worried about being held accountable for Pierre's debts, which far exceeded the value of the estate. But she knew she had to act fast to avoid any potential legal consequences. So, she decided to accept the succession under the beneficium inventarii.

This meant that Colette wouldn't be liable for the debts exceeding the value of the estate, as determined by the inventory. She would only be responsible for paying off the debts up to the value of the estate, which was relatively modest.

With a sigh of relief, Colette proceeded to settle the estate. She sold some of Pierre's assets, including his prized possession, a vintage car, to pay off the debts. After settling the estate, she was left with a modest inheritance, just enough to keep her and her own children afloat.

By accepting the succession under beneficium inventarii, Colette had shielded herself from the huge debts and could begin a new chapter in her life, unencumbered by her late husband's financial burdens."
Best interests	"Best interests or best interests of the child is a child rights principle, which derives from Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which says that ""in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration"". Assessing the best interests of a child means to evaluate and balance ""all the elements necessary to make a decision in a specific situation for a specific individual child or group of children""."	"Meet Emma, a 7-year-old girl who has been living with her mother, Sarah, since birth. Sarah and Emma's biological father, Jack, had a complicated relationship and eventually divorced when Emma was 5. Jack has now moved to a different state for work and wants to have more frequent visitations with Emma.

Sarah is hesitant, citing Jack's inconsistent parenting and concern that Emma might feel torn between the two of them. She fears that frequent visits would disrupt Emma's routine and possibly cause emotional distress.

In this situation, the court must consider what is in Emma's best interests. To do so, they would evaluate various factors, including her physical, emotional, and psychological well-being. They would also consider her needs and wishes, if age and maturity permit.

After conducting a thorough review, the court might decide to allow more frequent visitations with Jack, but with certain boundaries and monitoring to ensure Emma's emotional well-being. The court might also order counseling sessions for Sarah and Jack to help them develop a co-parenting plan that prioritizes Emma's needs.

By prioritizing Emma's best interests, the court ensures that she receives the emotional support and love from both parents while also protecting her from undue harm or confusion. In the story, this legal concept is put into practice, illustrating that in all actions concerning children, their best interests are the primary consideration."
Blue pencil doctrine	"The blue pencil doctrine is a legal concept in common law countries in which a court finds that portions of a contract are void or unenforceable, but other portions of the contract are enforceable. The blue pencil rule allows the legally valid enforceable provisions of the contract to stand despite the nullification of the legally void unenforceable provisions. However, the revised version must represent the original meaning. The rule may not be invoked, for example, to delete the word ""not"" and thereby change a negative to a positive."	"Here's a story to illustrate the blue pencil doctrine:

**The Blue Pencil Doctrine**

Rachel, a talented freelance writer, entered into a contract with her new client, Blue Horizon Magazine. The contract stated that she would write a 1,500-word article on ""The Benefits of Veganism"" for a guaranteed payment of $5,000. However, the contract also included a clause that deemed the payment forfeit if the article received fewer than 100 comments on social media within 14 days of publication. Rachel was concerned about the clause, as she had no control over how readers reacted to her article, but she really needed the work and the payment.

When Blue Horizon Magazine published the article, it received 30 comments within the first two days. The law firm representing Blue Horizon claimed that the media response clause was void because it made payment conditional on an unguaranteed event, leaving the party performing the obligation (Rachel) uncertain of its outcome. Rachel's team of lawyers countered that the payment clause was, in essence, a well-intentioned bonus system.

The judge decided that the media response clause was indeed void, as it was against public policy and uncertain in its outcome. However, cuttting that provision would not change the basic agreement: Rachel would write 1,500 words for $5,000. The judge applied the blue pencil doctrine, ruling that the payment provision stood, but the entire payment was now subject to the original condition: Rachel's successful completion of the writing assignment.

Rachel breathed a sigh of relief as the judge essentially ""blew in blue pencil"" through the defective condition, allowing the rest of the contract to be enforced, based on the court's understanding of the reasonable intention between the parties."
Boulevard rule	The boulevard rule is a principle in United States traffic law which states that the driver of a vehicle entering a highway from a smaller road or entrance (called the unfavored driver) must stop and yield the right of way to all highway traffic (the favored drivers).  The rule often comes into play in road accident cases, when a court must determine if a driver is negligent in causing a collision, due to his breach of the duty of care imposed by the rule on the unfavored driver.	"It was a sunny Saturday morning when Sarah, a young driver, decided to take the scenic route to her favorite beach. She had been driving on the quiet neighborhood roads for about 20 minutes when she decided to join the highway to avoid traffic congestion. As she approached the entrance ramp, she slowed down slightly, checking her mirrors and blind spots.

Meanwhile, John, a busy commuter, was speeding down the highway, heading to work. He was paying attention to the road, but he wasn't looking out for potential hazards. As Sarah merged onto the highway from the ramp, she didn't fully yield the right of way to John, who was approaching the entrance ramp at a high speed.

The two cars collided at the intersection, resulting in a fender bender. John's car was damaged, and he was shaken but unhurt. Sarah was shaken and worried about the consequences.

During the investigation, it became clear that Sarah, the driver entering the highway from the smaller road, had breached her duty of care under the boulevard rule. As the unfavored driver, she should have stopped and yielded the right of way to John, the favored driver who was traveling on the highway.

The court ruled that Sarah was negligent in the accident, as she failed to exercise due care when merging onto the highway. John's car damage was minimal, but he suffered emotional distress due to the sudden collision. In the end, Sarah was held responsible for the damages and was forced to pay compensation to John."
Brady disclosure	"In the legal system of the United States, a Brady disclosure consists of exculpatory or impeaching information and evidence that is material to the guilt or innocence or to the punishment of a defendant. The term comes from the 1963 U.S. Supreme Court case Brady v. Maryland, in which the Supreme Court ruled that suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to a defendant who has requested it violates due process. 
Following Brady, the prosecutor must disclose evidence or information that would prove the innocence of the defendant or would enable the defense to more effectively impeach the credibility of government witnesses. Evidence that would serve to reduce the defendant's sentence must also be disclosed by the prosecution. In practice, this doctrine has often proved difficult to enforce. Some states have established their own laws to try to strengthen enforcement against prosecutorial misconduct in this area.

"	"It was a chilly autumn morning when Detective James Harris arrived at the local police station to work on a new case. A young woman had been brutally murdered in her apartment, and the only suspect was her ex-boyfriend, Alex. The prosecution was building a strong case against Alex, relying heavily on eyewitness testimony from a neighbor who claimed to have seen him arguing with the victim just days before the murder.

But as Detective Harris began reviewing the evidence, he stumbled upon a crucial piece of information that had been withheld by the police. A previous statement from the neighbor revealed that he had actually seen another person, a known associate of the victim, lurking around the apartment complex on the night of the murder.

To Detective Harris' surprise, the police had intentionally omitted this crucial information from their reports and failed to share it with the defense team. Realizing that this information was material to the case and could potentially exonerate Alex, Detective Harris knew that he had to take action.

He brought the evidence to the attention of his supervisors and demanded that it be disclosed to the defense team, citing the Supreme Court's ruling in Brady v. Maryland. Although initially resistant, the prosecutor was eventually forced to comply with the discovery order, allowing the defense team to use this new evidence to challenge the prosecution's case.

Through this ordeal, Detective Harris came to understand the significance of Brady disclosure and the importance of transparency in the criminal justice system."
Burden of proof (law)	"In a legal dispute, one party has the burden of proof to show that they are correct, while the other party has no such burden and is presumed to be correct. The burden of proof requires a party to produce evidence to establish the truth of facts needed to satisfy all the required legal elements of the dispute. It is also known as the onus of proof.
The burden of proof is usually on the person who brings a claim in a dispute. It is often associated with the Latin maxim semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit, a translation of which is: ""the necessity of proof always lies with the person who lays charges."" In civil suits, for example, the plaintiff bears the burden of proof that the defendant's action or inaction caused injury to the plaintiff, and the defendant bears the burden of proving an affirmative defense. The burden of proof is on the prosecutor for criminal cases, and the defendant is presumed innocent. If the claimant fails to discharge the burden of proof to prove their case, the claim will be dismissed.

"	"It was a typical Monday morning for Emma, until she received a call from her former colleague, Jack, informing her that he had been working at the company's new project without her knowledge or permission. Emma was furious, as she had been utilized as the primary point of contact for the project during her tenure. She felt betrayed and decided to take legal action, citing a breach of contract and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

In court, Emma's lawyer, Rachel, presented evidence to show that Emma had indeed been utilized as the primary point of contact and that Jack's actions were in direct violation of their employment contract. Jack, on the other hand, denied any malicious intent and argued that his actions were justified due to an emergency situation at the project site.

The judge, in making his decision, ruled that the burden of proof lay with Emma, as she was the one who brought the claim. The judge stated that Emma needed to produce evidence to prove that she was correct, while Jack had no such burden and was presumed to be correct. Emma failed to present sufficient evidence to prove her case, and the court ruled in favor of Jack."
Calculus of negligence	"In the United States, the Hand formula, also known as the Hand rule, calculus of negligence, or BPL formula, is a conceptual formula created by Judge Learned Hand which describes a process for determining whether a legal duty of care has been breached (see negligence).  The original description of the calculus was in United States v. Carroll Towing Co., in which an improperly secured barge had drifted away from a pier and caused damage to several other boats.

"	"The Small Town Mariners

In the quaint coastal town of Seaview, the local marina was bustling with boats of all shapes and sizes. Charlie's Marina had been a staple in the community for generations, offering docking services, fuel, and a repair shop. Among its regular customers was Captain James, a seasoned sailor who owned a small fishing boat, the ""Sea Dog.""

One fateful evening, a powerful storm rolled in, causing strong winds and towering waves. The marina's manager, Ms. Rodriguez, decided to take precautions by securing the moored boats to prevent them from drifting away. She had her team remove the lines that tied the boats to their slips and replaced them with longer, heavier ropes.

However, in the chaos of the storm, one of the dockworkers, Jim, forgot to properly secure the ""Sea Dog"" to its slip. As the night wore on, the storm intensified, and the boat began to drift away from its mooring. Captain James hadn't tied himself to the boat, and as the ""Sea Dog"" disappeared into the darkness, he found himself lost in the stormy waters.

The next day, Captain James sued Ms. Rodriguez and Charlie's Marina for negligence, alleging that they had failed to ensure his boat's safety during the storm. In court, the judge applied the Hand formula to determine whether the marina had breached their duty of care. The formula took into account the magnitude of the risk or breach (the storm), the burden of the precaution (securing the boats with longer ropes), and the utility of the precaution (preventing damage to boats and property).

Ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Captain James, finding that the marina had failed to take reasonable measures to prevent the ""Sea Dog's"" loss, given the heightened risks posed by the storm. The Hand formula helped the court balance the competing interests and determine whether the marina had been negligent in their duty of care."
Capacity (law)	Legal capacity is a quality denoting either the legal aptitude of a person to have rights and liabilities (in this sense also called transaction capacity), or the personhood itself in regard to an entity other than a natural person (in this sense also called legal personality).	"Meet Jane, a 17-year-old high school student who has been saving up money for a new laptop. She goes to the local electronics store with her best friend, Sarah, who is 18 years old. Jane and Sarah test out some laptops, and Jane decides she wants to buy one. Sarah convinces Jane to let her sign the contract on behalf of Jane, promising to give Jane the money afterwards.

Unbeknownst to Jane, the store requires all customers to be at least 18 years old to enter into a contract, which is a testament to their legal capacity to do so. Jane, being underage, does not have the legal capacity to enter into a contract on her own. Sarah, being of age, has the legal capacity to enter into a contract, but she has no authority to bind Jane to a contract without her consent.

Later, the store tries to collect payment from Jane, but she refuses, saying she never intended to buy the laptop. The store sues Jane and her parents for breach of contract. In court, the judge rules that Jane did not have the legal capacity to enter into a contract with the store, and therefore, the contract is void. The judge orders the store to return the laptop to Jane and pays Jane's parents to settle the matter.

This story illustrates the legal concept of capacity, highlighting that a person's age and authority can impact their ability to enter into a contract and take on legal obligations. While Jane had the ability to make a decision about buying a laptop, she lacked the legal capacity to enter into a binding contract due to her age."
Carltona doctrine	The Carltona doctrine (or Carltona principle) expresses the idea that, in United Kingdom law, the acts of government departmental officials are synonymous with the actions of the minister in charge of that department. The point was established in Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works.	"Here's a short story that illustrates the Carltona doctrine:

Emily was a local small business owner who rented a large plot of land from the government to use as a parking lot for her clients. As her business grew, she needed to expand her operations and requested permission from the Ministry of Transport to increase the size of the parking lot. The department's administrative assistant, Rosa, was responsibile for processing Emily's application.

Rosa, seemingly in an effort to help the small business thrive, went ahead and signed off on Emily's expansion proposal without properly following the standard procedure, which required approval from higher authorities. A year later, a top official noticed the irregularity and sought to revoke the approval, citing that Rosa didn't have the authority to sign on behalf of the minister.

Emily fought against the revocation, claiming she relied on Rosa's office as the acting ministers, and expected their decisions to be final. Her lawyer argued that the Carltona doctrine applied, making Rosa's actions synonymous with the actual minister's. In the end, the court ruled that Emily was correct. Rosa's actions, as the administrative assistant of the Ministry of Transport, were under the authority of the minister, effectively binding Emily's contract and preventing the revocation of her expansion.

This verdict makes it clear: when a public official makes a binding decision as part of their duties, their action is representative of the department's authority as a whole."
Castle doctrine	"A castle doctrine, also known as a castle law or a defense of habitation law, is a legal doctrine that designates a person's abode or any legally occupied place (for example, an automobile or a home) as a place in which that person has protections and immunities permitting one, in certain circumstances, to use force (up to and including deadly force) to defend oneself against an intruder, free from legal prosecution for the consequences of the force used. The term is most commonly used in the United States, though many other countries invoke comparable principles in their laws.
Depending on the location, a person may have a duty to retreat to avoid violence if one can reasonably do so. Castle doctrines lessen the duty to retreat when an individual is assaulted within one's own home. Deadly force may either be justified, the burdens of production and proof for charges impeded, or an affirmative defense against criminal homicide applicable, in cases ""when the actor reasonably fears imminent peril of death or serious bodily harm to him or herself or another."" The castle doctrine is not a defined law that can be invoked, but a set of principles which may be incorporated in some form in many jurisdictions. Castle doctrines may not provide civil immunity, such as from wrongful death suits, which have a much lower burden of proof.
Justifiable homicide is a legally blameless killing in self-defense. A justifiable homicide that occurs within the home is distinct as a matter of law from castle doctrine, because the mere occurrence of trespassing—and occasionally a subjective requirement of fear—is sufficient to invoke the castle doctrine, under which the burden of proof of fact is much less challenging than that of justifying homicide in self-defense. However, the existence in a legal code of such a provision (of justifiable homicide in self-defense pertaining to one's domicile) does not imply the creation of a castle doctrine protecting the estate and exonerating any duty to retreat. The use of this legal principle in the United States has been controversial in relation to a number of cases in which it has been invoked, including the deaths of Japanese exchange student Yoshihiro Hattori and Scottish businessman Andrew de Vries."	"The sun had just set on suburban Oakwood, and John was settling into his favorite armchair in his cozy home. He was exhausted from a long day at work and looked forward to unwinding with a good book. Suddenly, he heard a loud knock at the door. He ignored it, thinking it was probably just a neighbor stopping by or a delivery for his wife, Sarah.

A few minutes later, the knocking continued, and this time it sounded louder and more insistent. John's instincts kicked in, and he grabbed the phone to call 911, but as he stood up to get to the door, he heard a voice saying, ""Hello, anyone home?""

John's heart racing, he slowly made his way to the door, peering through the peephole. A stranger, dressed in dark clothing, stared back at him. John immediately felt a sense of unease and fear. Under the castle doctrine, John knew he was within his rights to defend himself and his home.

Without hesitation, John opened the door, but not wide enough for the stranger to enter. He repeatedly asked the stranger to leave, but he refused, advancing towards John. John, feeling threatened and fearing for his life, used the necessary force to subdue the intruder.

As it turned out, the stranger was a thief who had been targeting homes in the neighborhood. John's actions that night not only saved himself but also potentially saved his neighbors from a similar ordeal. In this scenario, John was well within his rights to defend himself under the castle doctrine, leveraging the principle of ""stand your ground"" to ensure his safety and security in his own home."
Caveat emptor	"Caveat emptor (; from caveat, ""may he/she beware"", a subjunctive form of cavēre, ""to beware"" + ēmptor, ""buyer"") is Latin for ""Let the buyer beware"". It has become a proverb in English. Generally, caveat emptor is the contract law principle that controls the sale of real property after the date of closing, but may also apply to sales of other goods. The phrase caveat emptor and its use as a disclaimer of warranties arises from the fact that buyers typically have less information than the seller about the good or service they are purchasing. This quality of the situation is known as 'information asymmetry'. Defects in the good or service may be hidden from the buyer, and only known to the seller.
It is a short form of Caveat emptor, quia ignorare non debuit quod jus alienum emit (""Let a purchaser beware, for he ought not to be ignorant of the nature of the property which he is buying from another party."") I.e. the buyer should assure himself that the product is good and that the seller had the right to sell it, as opposed to receiving stolen property.
A common way that information asymmetry between seller and buyer has been addressed is through a legally binding warranty, such as a guarantee of satisfaction.

"	"Here's a story to help illustrate the concept of Caveat Emptor:

Lena had been looking for a new used bicycle for months, and finally found a vintage road bike listed online for sale by a local collectibles shop, ""Cycle Classics"". The shop's ad described the bike as a ""vintage beauty"" in ""excellent working condition"". Lena had always wanted a bike like this, and the price was negotiable. She had no experience with bikes from that era, but the mechanic at Cycle Classics assured her it was a rare and valuable collector's item.

Lena handed over her money and had the bike transported to her home. At first, the bike seemed fine, but as she began to ride it, she noticed the brakes were wobbly and the chain kept coming loose. A trip to a local bike shop revealed that the bike was a rare bike, but also had major issues with its shock-absorbing system and faulty gears. Lena was frustrated - she had paid a significant amount for a bike that clearly needed extensive repairs.

As she contacted Cycle Classics to return the bike or ask for a refund, the shop owner explained that they had sold her the bike in ""as-is"" condition, meaning they made no promises about its quality or functionality. It turned out that the bike had had several previous owners who had made different modifications and fixes over the years, which not all were documented.

In this case, Cycle Classics is not liable for the bike's defects because Lena had entered the sale as-is and the shop had made no guarantees about the bike's condition. This is an example of the principle of Caveat Emptor in action, reminding buyers that it's their responsibility to investigate, inspect, and take their own precautions before buying - especially when purchasing used items."

I.e. the buyer should assure himself that the product is good and that the seller had the right to sell it, as opposed to receiving stolen property.
A common way that information asymmetry between seller and buyer has been addressed is through a legally binding warranty, such as a guarantee of satisfaction.

"	"As I walked into the vintage record store, I couldn't help but geek out over the rows of dusty vinyls and rare albums. I had been searching for this exact LP, ""The Beatles' Abbey Road,"" for months, and finally, I had found it. The store owner, a friendly old man with a bushy beard, pointed me to the corner where it was neatly displayed.

""You know, this is one of the rarest albums in the world,"" he said with a sly grin. I didn't think much of it, assuming he was just being dramatic.

I purchased the album and proudly took it home. Only when I played it did I discover that it was a damaged, worn-out copy, not the mint condition I had been expecting. The music was scratchy, and the cover art was torn.

Feeling ripped off, I contacted the store owner, who was less than apologetic. ""You should have checked it out better before you bought it,"" he said, citing the age-old principle: caveat emptor – let the buyer beware.

In retrospect, I should have inspected the album more closely before purchasing it. The store owner had no legal obligation to guarantee the condition of the record, despite his initial boast about its rarity. It was up to me, the buyer, to do my due diligence.

In the end, I had to settle for a replacement from a different seller who offered a satisfaction guarantee. The experience taught me a valuable lesson: always beware of hidden defects when making a purchase, especially when dealing with used or unique items. And if you're buying something, make sure you get it in writing – after all, the buyer should always beware!"
Child migration	"Child migration or ""children in migration or mobility"" (sometimes more generally ""children on the move"") is the movement of people ages 3–18 within or across political borders, with or without their parents or a legal guardian, to another country or region. They may travel with or without legal travel documents. They may arrive to the destination country as refugees, asylum seekers, or economic migrants."	"Here is a short story that illustrates the concept of child migration:

Meet 12-year-old Maria, who lived in a small village in Central America with her parents and three younger siblings. Due to severe poverty and lack of opportunities, Maria's parents made the difficult decision to leave their homeland in search of a better life in the United States. However, they couldn't take all of their children with them, as they were not sure if they would be able to settle permanently or if they would be able to afford to send for the rest of the family.

Maria, feeling responsible for her younger siblings, decided to take a chance and join her parents in the United States. She was determined to help support her family and provide a better future for her siblings. With a mixture of excitement and fear, Maria set out on a challenging journey, traveling through Mexico with a group of other unaccompanied minors.

After several weeks of travel, Maria finally arrived at the U.S. border, where she was taken into custody by immigration authorities. Although she was alone and scared, Maria claimed asylum, explaining that she was fleeing poverty and persecution in her home country. Due to her young age and vulnerability, Maria was placed in a shelter for unaccompanied minors, where she received food, clothing, and medical care. Eventually, she was reunited with her parents, and they began the process of applying for legal status in the United States. Maria's journey highlights the complex issues surrounding child migration, including the push and pull factors that drive children to leave their homes, and the challenges they face when seeking asylum in a new country."
Clausula rebus sic stantibus	"Clausula rebus sic stantibus is the legal doctrine allowing for a contract or a treaty to become inapplicable because of a fundamental change of circumstances. In public international law the doctrine essentially serves an ""escape clause"" to the general rule of pacta sunt servanda (promises must be kept).: 28  Because the doctrine is a risk to the security of treaties, as its scope is relatively unconfined, the conditions in which it may be invoked must be carefully noted.: 23–28  
This term is related to force majeure and hardship clause."	"Here's a short story that illustrates the concept of ""Clausula rebus sic stantibus"":

Maria and Ahmed had been working on a joint business venture to build a large solar farm in a remote desert location. Their contract, signed five years ago, had certain terms that made sense at the time: they would import equipment from Europe at preferential rates, and Ahmed's company would provide the land free of charge. However, since the contract was signed, the EU had imposed a steep import tax on solar panels from Europe, and the land that Ahmed's company had promised to provide had been announced as a national park, requiring a significant area to be surrendered for wildlife conservation.

As the project's profitability had become increasingly uncertain, Maria and Ahmed tried to renegotiate their contract, but the changes in the external circumstances (the import tax and the national park designation) had rendered their initial agreement no longer viable. Maria argued that the changes in circumstances (rebus sic stantibus) should allow them to reconsider their agreement and adapt to the new reality. Ahmed, on the other hand, believed they should stick to the original terms and pay the additional import tax and return the area taken over by the wildlife reserve. Maria's lawyers successfully petitioned the court to invoke the rebus sic stantibus doctrine, arguing that the drastic changes in circumstances should release them from their commitment to the original agreement. As a result, they renegotiated the terms of their contract to better suit the new reality.

This scenario illustrates how a change in circumstances can impact the enforceability of an agreement and the importance of the rebus sic stantibus doctrine in adapting contracts to accommodate unforeseen external changes."
Clean hands	"Clean hands, sometimes called the clean hands doctrine, unclean hands doctrine, or dirty hands doctrine, is an equitable defense in which the defendant argues that the plaintiff is not entitled to obtain an equitable remedy because the plaintiff is acting unethically or has acted in bad faith with respect to the subject of the complaint—that is, with ""unclean hands"". The defendant has the burden of proof to show the plaintiff is not acting in good faith. The doctrine is often stated as ""those seeking equity must do equity"" or ""equity must come with clean hands"". This is a matter of protocol, characterised by A. P. Herbert in Uncommon Law by his fictional Judge Mildew saying (as Herbert says, ""less elegantly""), ""A dirty dog will not have justice by the court"".
A defendant's unclean hands can also be claimed and proven by the plaintiff to claim other equitable remedies and to prevent that defendant from asserting equitable affirmative defenses. In other words, 'unclean hands' can be used offensively by the plaintiff as well as defensively by the defendant. Historically, the doctrine of unclean hands can be traced as far back as the Fourth Lateran Council.
""He who comes into equity must come with clean hands"" is an equitable maxim in English law."	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of ""clean hands"":

Samantha had rented a small house in a quiet neighborhood to a young couple, Emily and Ryan, under a year-long lease agreement. When the lease expired, Samantha informed them that she wanted to sell the house, and would be terminating the property agreement. However, she also told Emily and Ryan that if they would like to stay in the house beyond the lease term, they could do so, but only if they agreed to a 30% rent increase.

Emily and Ryan were financially struggling, but they really loved the house and asked if they could negotiate a lower rent increase. Samantha refused, citing the increasing expenses of maintaining the property. However, a neighbor came forward and shared that Samantha had been secretly selling the land underlying the rented house to a deHere's a short story illustrating the concept of ""unclean hands"":

Samantha, a homeowner, sues her neighbor, James, for breaching their shared property line. Samantha claims that James built a fence on her side of the boundary without her permission. She demands that the court order James to tear down the fence and pay her damages.

However, the court discovers that Samantha has been secretly using James's property to store her own gardening equipment and tools without his knowledge or permission. In fact, she has been using a hose to water her plants on James's side of the line for months, causing damage to his landscaping.

The court finds that Samantha is not acting in good faith. She is accusing James of breaching the agreement when, in fact, she has been equally guilty of exploiting their shared property line for her own advantage. The court rules that Samantha has ""unclean hands"" and is therefore not entitled to seek an equitable remedy.

James had been unaware of Samantha's ongoing trespass and had no intention of harming her by building the fence on her side of the boundary. By coming to the court with unclean hands, Samantha has put herself in a position where she is denied the relief she sought.

The court's decision sends a message that those who seek equitable remedies must demonstrate good faith and come to the table with clean hands. If they do not, they risk being denied relief, allowing them to bear the burden of their own wrongdoing."
Collateral source rule	"The collateral source rule, or collateral source doctrine, is an American case law evidentiary rule that prohibits the admission of evidence that the plaintiff or victim has received compensation from some source other than the damages sought against the defendant. The purpose of the rule is to ensure that the wrongful party pays the full cost of the harm caused, so that future harmful conduct is thereby deterred or, at least, fully included in the defendant's cost of doing business.  Subrogation and indemnification principles then commonly provide that the person who paid the initial compensation to the plaintiff or victim has a right to recover any double recovery from the plaintiff or victim.  For example, in a personal injury action, evidence that the plaintiff's medical bills were paid by medical insurance, or by workers' compensation, is not generally admissible and the plaintiff can recover the amount of those bills from the defendant. If the plaintiff then collects the amount of medical bills from the defendant, that amount is then typically paid by the plaintiff to the insurance carrier under principles of subrogation and indemnification.
The collateral source doctrine has come under attack by tort reform advocates. They argue that if the plaintiff's injuries and damages have already been compensated, it is unfair and duplicative to allow an award of damages against the tortfeasor. As a result some states have altered or partially abrogated the rule by statute.  Proponents of the rule note that without it, the wrongdoer [tortfeasor] gets the benefit of the injured party carrying insurance or obtaining minimal benefits through government programs and obtains a form of subsidy where the wrongdoer does not pay the full cost of their wrongful conduct but instead transfers some of that cost [insurance premiums] to the victims causing insurance rates to be higher.  
Nevertheless, some courts have held that the rule ought not to provide a safe haven in a contract action for an unfaithful contracting party."	"**The Auto Accident and the Collateral Source Rule**

On a sunny evening, Emily was driving home from work when another driver, James, ran a red light and slammed into her car. Emily suffered a broken arm and a shattered windshield. She received medical treatment and incurred around $10,000 in medical bills.

Fortunately, Emily had comprehensive health insurance that covered the full cost of her medical treatment, including her emergency room visit, surgery, and rehabilitation. The insurance company paid the $10,000 bill directly to the medical providers.

When Emily sued James for damages, she sought compensation for her medical expenses, pain and suffering, and lost wages. In court, James's defense team wanted to introduce evidence that Emily's medical bills had been paid by her insurance company. However, the judge ruled that this evidence was inadmissible under the collateral source rule.

The judge explained that under this rule, Emily's insurance benefits were a ""collateral source"" that didn't affect James's liability for his actions. This meant that the court could still award Emily compensation for her medical expenses, even though they had been paid by her insurance company. James was then responsible for paying the entire $10,000, and Emily's insurance company would not be required to pay the bill again. If James disputes this decision, his insurance company might have the right to seek reimbursement if he was found liable."
Command responsibility	"In the practice of international law, command responsibility (also superior responsibility) is the legal doctrine of hierarchical accountability for war crimes, whereby a commanding officer (military) and a superior officer (civil) are legally responsible for the war crimes and the crimes against humanity committed by his subordinates; thus, a commanding officer always is accountable for the acts of commission and the acts of omission of his soldiers.
In the late 19th century, the legal doctrine of command responsibility was codified in the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, which are partly based upon the Lieber Code (General Orders No. 100, 24 April 1863), military law that legally allowed the Union Army to fight in the regular and the irregular modes of warfare deployed by the Confederacy during the American Civil War (1861–1865). As international law, the legal doctrine and the term command responsibility were applied and used in the Leipzig war crimes trials (1921) that included the trial of Captain Emil Müller for prisoner abuse committed by his soldiers during the First World War (1914–1918).
In the 20th century, in the late 1940s, the Yamashita standard derived from the incorporation into the U.S. Code of the developments of the legal doctrine of command responsibility presented in the Nuremberg trials (1945–1946). Abiding by that legal precedent, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the U.S. prosecution of the war crimes case against Imperial Japanese Army General Tomoyuki Yamashita for the atrocities committed by his soldiers in the Philippine Islands, in the Pacific Theatre (1941–1945) of the Second World War. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East charged, tried, and judged Gen. Yamashita for ""unlawfully disregarding, and failing to discharge, his duty as a commander to control the acts of members of his command, by permitting them to commit war crimes"".
In the 20th century, in the early 1970s, the Medina standard expanded the U.S. Code to include the criminal liability of American military officers for the war crimes committed by their subordinates, as are the war-criminal military officers of an enemy power. The Medina standard was established in the court martial of U.S. Army Captain Ernest Medina in 1971 for not exercising his command authority as a company commander, by not acting to halt the My Lai massacre (16 March 1968) committed by his soldiers during the Vietnam War (1955–1975)."	"The sun was setting over the dusty desert landscape as Colonel Jameson stood in front of his platoon, his voice firm but worn. ""Listen up, men,"" he began, his words dripping with a mix of fatigue and frustration. ""I know what's been going on out there. I know some of you have been unfairly targeting innocent civilians, and for that, I'm truly sorry. But I assure you, my apologies will be meaningless if we don't get our priorities straight.""

The men looked at each other, some with guilt-ridden glances, others with indifference. One of the soldiers, a young private, whispered to another, ""Why should we care? We're winning the war, and the Colonel's just asking for trouble.""

As the days went by, the platoon's behavior only deteriorated. Jameson did nothing to stop it, choosing instead to focus on his own career advancement. He neglected his duties as a commander, and the consequences were devastating. Civilians were unfairly treated, and the reputation of the entire unit was tarnished.

Years later, Jameson stood before a court, his crimes of omission exposed. The judge's voice was stern, ""As a commander, it is your duty to control the acts of your subordinates. By permitting them to commit war crimes, you assumed a criminal liability. You are held accountable for the acts of commission and the acts of omission of your soldiers.""

Jameson's face fell as the weight of his guilt became clear. He had prioritized his own interests over the well-being of his men and the innocent civilians they were sworn to protect. The doctrine of command responsibility had finally caught up with him, and justice had been served.

This relatable scenario helps non-experts understand the concept of command responsibility, demonstrating that even military officers, like Colonel Jameson, can be held accountable for the war crimes committed by their subordinates, and for their own failure to act and prevent such crimes."
Commanding precedent	"In law, a commanding precedent is a precedent whose facts are ""on all fours"" with the case at hand. In other words, it almost exactly tracks it, sharing near-identical facts and issues. A commanding precedent is also referred to as a ""Goose"" case in Louisiana; ""Spotted Horse"" or ""Spotted Dog"" cases in Alabama; ""Cow"" case in Kansas; and ""White Horse"" or ""White Pony"" cases in Texas. A legal rule can be ""clearly established"" without commanding precedent existing. For example, in the United States, a governmental official is generally protected by qualified immunity if his acts were objectively legally reasonable, but such protection may not apply if, in light of pre-existing law, the unlawfulness of his conduct would have been apparent to a reasonably competent official, even if no commanding precedent applicable to his specific behavior existed."	"Meet Emily, a busy working mom who often finds herself stuck in traffic on her daily commute to the city. One day, while driving to work, she gets behind a school bus that is speeding down the highway, putting multiple lives at risk. Frustrated and concerned for the safety of the children on board, Emily decides to follow the bus and alert the authorities about the unsafe driving.

Upon pulling over the bus, the school bus driver, Mr. Johnson, pulls out a gun and threatens Emily, telling her to step away from the vehicle. Emily, feeling threatened, calls 911 and emergency services arrive at the scene. Mr. Johnson is subsequently arrested and charged with reckless endangerment and assault.

Emily is left shaken but grateful that the situation didn't escalate further. However, after the incident, she begins to wonder if she took the right decision. Was her action justifiable?

Here, a commanding precedent comes into play. In a similar case, ""State v. Smith"" (1997), a citizen had also stopped a speeding school bus, only to be met with threats from the driver. The court ruled that the citizen had acted reasonably and lawfully in stopping the bus, considering the safety of the children on board. This precedent (or ""Spotted Horse"" case) can be applied to Emily's situation, as the facts are nearly identical. It demonstrates that, in the eyes of the law, Emily's actions were not only justifiable but also justified, providing a clear understanding of what is considered the ""right"" action in this situation.

This story showcases how a commanding precedent can provide a clear and applicable legal rule, illustrating the concept of commanding precedent and its importance in real-life legal situations."
Common employment	"Common employment was an historical defence in English tort law that said workers implicitly undertook the risks of being injured by their co-workers, with whom they were in ""common employment"". The US labor law terminology was the ""fellow servant rule""."	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of common employment:

**The Construction Site Accident**

It's a typical Monday morning at the Smith Brothers Construction Site in Manchester. Tom and Jack, two laborers, are working on a construction project to build a new office building. They're tasked with lifting a heavy beam into place using a pulley system. As they're struggling to maneuver the beam, Jack, who's standing below, loses his footing and is hit by the falling beam. Tom, who was holding the beam, tries to regain control but is temporarily distracted by a member of the site's management rushing to give instructions. The beam swings off course and hits Jack with great force, injuring him severely.

At the time, the law held that because Tom and Jack were both employees of Smith Brothers Construction, they were considered to be in ""common employment."" This meant that if you or your colleagues were injured in the course of doing your job, you took on the risks inherent to completing that same job.

In this scenario, since Jack was a fellow employee of Tom's, any injuries he suffered as a result of Tom's momentary lapse in judgment or accidental loss of control of the beam were considered his own responsibility, rather than a liability of the company. The courts ruled that in this situation, the employer's liability was limited, and Jack had implicitly taken on the risks of being injured by his fellow employee. This position was eventually abrogated in many jurisdictions, which now allow injured workers to reclaim damages from their employers in many cases where the risk of injury was unreasonable or could have been greatly mitigated."
Comparative negligence	Comparative negligence, called non-absolute contributory negligence outside the United States, is a partial legal defense that reduces the amount of damages that a plaintiff can recover in a negligence-based claim, based upon the degree to which the plaintiff's own negligence contributed to cause the injury. When the defense is asserted, the factfinder, usually a jury, must decide the degree to which the plaintiff's negligence and the combined negligence of all other relevant actors all contributed to cause the plaintiff's damages. It is a modification of the doctrine of contributory negligence that disallows any recovery by a plaintiff whose negligence contributed even minimally to causing the damages.	"As Sarah walked to work on a rainy morning, she failed to notice the yellow traffic cones blocking a lane due to a construction accident. Unbeknownst to her, a car was speeding around the cone and swerved into her path. Sarah, distracted by her phone, didn't react quickly enough and was hit by the car.

Sarah suffered serious injuries and filed a lawsuit against the driver, alleging negligence. In court, the judge instructed the jury to consider the concept of comparative negligence. The jury heard testimony from both sides and ultimately concluded that Sarah was 30% responsible for the accident due to her distraction by her phone, while the driver was 70% responsible for speeding and not following traffic safety guidelines.

Under the comparative negligence rule, Sarah's damages were reduced by 30%. She was awarded $50,000, which was 70% of her original claim. The driver's insurance company paid Sarah the reduced amount, minus the 30% attributed to Sarah's own negligence.

This outcome illustrates the legal concept of comparative negligence. The jury assessed the degree to which both parties contributed to the accident and reduced Sarah's damages accordingly. Had she been deemed even 1% responsible, she would have been barred from recovering any damages under the doctrine of contributory negligence. As it stands, Sarah received a significant portion of her damages, but not the full amount due to her own partial negligence."
Condemned property	A condemned property or a condemned building is a property or building that local (usually municipal) authorities have closed, seized, or placed restrictions on for various reasons, including public safety and public health, in accordance with local ordinance.	"The old Johnson residence on Elm Street had been a staple in the community for decades. However, as the years went by, the once-grand home began to deteriorate. Peeling paint, broken windows, and overgrown vegetation became a hazardous eyesore, attracting pests and rodents. Neighbors complained about the smell of mold and sewage wafting from the Property, and local children were warned to stay away.

One sweltering summer day, the city's Department of Public Works (DPW) issued a notice to the Johnson family, ordering them to vacate the premises due to hazardous conditions and threats to public health. The family, struggling to keep up with insurance claims and medical bills, reluctantly complied. As they packed their belongings, they knew they had to find alternative housing.

As the DPW sealed the property, residents cheered. Finally, the eyesore on their block was gone. The city's nuisance ordinance gave it the authority to condemn properties deemed a threat to public safety and health. Without a viable owner to address the issues, the city's action was mandatory to protect the community. The once-loved Johnson home stood as a testament to the importance of condemning hazardous properties, ensuring the well-being of all who live nearby.

The story highlights how condemned property laws work, focusing on a relatable scenario where a decaying structure poses a risk to public health and well-being, necessitating the local authorities' intervention."
Consideration	"Consideration is a concept of English common law and is a necessity for simple contracts but not for special contracts (contracts by deed). The concept has been adopted by other common law jurisdictions. It is commonly referred to as one of the six or seven elements of a contract.
The court in Currie v Misa declared consideration to be a ""Right,  Interest,  Profit,  Benefit, or Forbearance,  Detriment,  Loss,  Responsibility"". Thus, consideration is a promise of something of value given by a promissor in exchange for something of value given by a promisee; and typically the thing of value is goods, money, or an act. Forbearance to act, such as an adult promising to refrain from smoking, is enforceable only if one is thereby surrendering a legal right.
Consideration may be thought of as the concept of value offered and accepted by people or organisations entering into contracts. Anything of value promised by one party to the other when making a contract can be treated as ""consideration"": for example, if A contracts to buy a car from B for $5,000, A's consideration is the promise of $5,000, and B's consideration is the promise of the car.
Additionally, if A signs a contract with B such that A will paint B's house for $500, A's consideration is the service of painting B's house, and B's consideration is $500 paid to A. Further if A signs a contract with B such that A will not repaint his own house in any other colour than white, and B will pay A $500 per year to keep this deal up, there is also a consideration. Although A did not promise to affirmatively do anything, A did promise not to do something that he was allowed to do, and so A did pass consideration. A's consideration to B is the forbearance in painting his own house in a colour other than white, and B's consideration to A is $500 per year. Conversely, if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $0, B's consideration is still the car, but A is giving no consideration, and so there is no valid contract. However, if B still gives the title to the car to A, then B cannot take the car back, since, while it may not be a valid contract, it is a valid gift."	"Meet Emma, a freelance graphic designer, and her client, Rachel, a small business owner. Emma agrees to design a logo for Rachel's new bakery for a flat fee of $1,000. In return, Rachel promises to provide Emma with a free cake every month for a year.

In this scenario, the consideration is the value exchanged between Emma and Rachel. Emma's consideration is the promise to design the logo, which is a valuable service. Rachel's consideration is the promise to provide Emma with a free cake every month, which is a valuable benefit to Emma.

The court would view this agreement as a valid contract because both parties have provided something of value to each other. Emma has promised to provide a service (designing the logo), and Rachel has promised to provide a benefit (free cakes). This exchange of value is the essence of consideration.

In this example, consideration is not just about money. Emma's consideration is not just the $1,000 payment, but also the service she provides. Rachel's consideration is not just the $1,000 payment, but also the free cakes she provides. This highlights the broader concept of consideration, which encompasses not just financial transactions but also the exchange of other valuable things, such as services, benefits, or even forbearance (as in the example of Emma not painting her own house in a color other than white).

In the end, Emma and Rachel have entered into a valid contract, and both parties are bound by their promises."
Constitutional convention (political custom)	"A convention, also known as a constitutional convention, is an uncodified tradition that is followed by the institutions of a state. In some states, notably those Commonwealth states that follow the Westminster system and whose political systems derive from British constitutional law, most government functions are guided by constitutional convention rather than by a formal written constitution. In these states, actual distribution of power may be markedly different from those the formal constitutional documents describe. In particular, the formal constitution often confers wide discretionary powers on the head of state that, in practice, are used only on the advice of the head of government, and in some cases not at all.
Some constitutional conventions operate separately from or alongside written constitutions, such as in Canada since the country was formed with the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1867. In others, notably the United Kingdom, which lack a single overarching constitutional document, unwritten conventions are still of vital importance in understanding how the state functions. In most states, however, many old conventions have been replaced or superseded by laws (called codification).
Historical entities often had strong emphasis on constitutional convention. For example the constitution of the Roman Republic was codified comparatively late in its development and relied for its functioning on traditions and a shared moral code called mos maiorum. In the Holy Roman Empire such important issues as who could elect the emperor were entirely uncodified before the Golden Bull of 1356 and remained subject to a certain degree of interpretation well afterwards."	"In the small town of Oakdale, nestled in the heart of the countryside, the local government had always operated according to a set of unwritten rules, known as constitutional conventions. These customs had been passed down through generations, shaping the way the town council made decisions and interacted with the community.

For years, the mayor, Rachel, had been accustomed to seeking advice from the town's oldest and wisest resident, John, before making any major decisions. This unspoken tradition had been honored by every mayor before her, and it had become an essential part of Oakdale's code of conduct. However, when a new mayor, Emily, took office, she began to question this convention.

Emily believed that the town council should make decisions independently, without relying on outside influence. She argued that the mayor should only seek advice from department heads and town staff, according to written procedures. Rachel and the town council disagreed, insisting that John's counsel had always brought valuable insight and helped the town avoid mistakes.

The issue led to a heated debate, with some arguing that the convention was merely a tradition and not a formal rule. Others claimed that it was essential to the town's character and history. In the end, Emily decided to respect the convention, recognizing that it was integral to the town's fabric. Rachel and John continued to provide guidance, and the town council made decisions that benefited the community as a whole.

This story illustrates the concept of constitutional conventions, where unwritten customs and traditions guide the decision-making process in a particular entity. In this case, the convention had been observed for years, and its violation was met with resistance. The story highlights the importance of understanding and respecting these customs, even when they may not be codified in law."
Constitutional conventions of the United Kingdom	The United Kingdom has an uncodified constitution. The constitution consists of legislation, common law, Crown prerogative and constitutional conventions. Conventions may be written or unwritten. They are principles of behaviour which are not legally enforceable, but form part of the constitution by being enforced on a political, professional or personal level. Written conventions can be found in the Ministerial Code, Cabinet Manual, Guide to Judicial Conduct, Erskine May and even legislation. Unwritten conventions exist by virtue of long-practice or may be referenced in other documents such as the Lascelles Principles.	"It's a typical Monday morning in London, and Prime Minister Alice is hosting a meeting with the Queen at Buckingham Palace to discuss a new government policy. As they sit down in the grand state room, Alice notices that the Queen seems particularly keen to emphasize the importance of maintaining the ceremonial role of the monarch.

Feeling slightly taken aback, Alice realizes that this is an unwritten convention they've been following for decades – the monarch doesn't interfere with the day-to-day governing of the country, leaving that to the Prime Minister and their cabinet. It's not something that's written down in law, but it's an understood principle that guides their actions.

As they discuss the policy, Alice decides to remind the Queen that the government will be setting up a new parliamentary committee to oversee the implementation of the policy. The Queen nods in agreement, knowing that this is a standard convention – the government doesn't make decisions without consulting and working with Parliament.

As they conclude the meeting, Alice feels grateful for the unwritten conventions that guide their meetings. They may not be legally binding, but they help to ensure that the relationship between the government and the monarch remains smooth and respectful. She leaves the palace feeling confident that the government will be able to work effectively with the Queen, knowing that their shared understanding of the conventions will guide them towards a successful outcome."
Contra principia negantem non est disputandum	"Contra principia negantem non est disputandum (Latin, alternatively Contra principia negantem disputari non potest and Contra principia negantem disputari nequit; literally, ""Against one who denies the principles, there can be no debate"") is a principle of logic and law: in order to debate reasonably about a disagreement, there must be agreement about the principles or facts by which to judge the arguments."	"Here's a story that illustrates the legal concept of 'Contra principia negantem non est disputandum':

Alex and Sarah were estate lawyers arguing over the distribution of their deceased client's assets. The client had named Alex as the sole beneficiary in his will, while Sarah believed the client had promised to leave her a significant portion of the estate. Sarah claimed that Alex had forged the will to enrich himself.

Alex insisted that he had nothing to do with the will's creation, but Sarah was adamant that he was behind the forgery. Despite their heated debate, they found themselves at an impasse. Alex argued that since the will was legally binding, Sarah's claims were unfounded. Sarah countered that the will was invalid because the client was coerced into signing it.

As the argument escalated, they realized that they were talking past each other. Alex was assessing the validity of the will solely based on the client's intentions, while Sarah was focusing on the client's actions. It dawned on them that they were operating under different principles: Alex was using the court's established will-making procedures as his guide, while Sarah was relying on her own interpretation of their client's motives.

Frustrated and exhausted, they agreed to seek a mediator's help. The mediator pointed out that they were dismissing each other's perspectives without considering the relevant facts and principles. With fresh eyes, they were able to reframe their discussion, focusing on the evidence and the court's established criteria for will interpretation. By the end of the mediation, they had a clearer understanding of their disagreements and were able to reach a compromise that satisfied both parties.

In this scenario, the characters illustrate the concept 'Contra principia negantem non est disputandum', demonstrating that a productive debate requires shared understanding of the fundamental principles and facts."
Contra proferentem	"Contra proferentem (Latin: ""against [the] offeror""), also known as ""interpretation against the draftsman"", is a doctrine of contractual interpretation providing that, where a promise, agreement or term is ambiguous, the preferred meaning should be the one that works against the interests of the party who provided the wording."	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of Contra proferentem:

Meet Sarah, a small business owner who hires a famous marketing guru, Jack, to create a social media campaign for her new boutique. Jack proposes a contract that includes a clause stating that his company will be responsible for ""ensuring the campaign's success 'to the best of their abilities'"". Sarah signs the contract, thinking that means Jack's team will work diligently to deliver results.

However, things don't go as planned. The campaign flops, and Sarah is left with a significant loss. When she demands Jack's team do better, Jack argues that the contract's clause means only that they will try their best, but it doesn't guarantee success. The court is asked to interpret the contract.

Under the doctrine of Contra proferentem, the court rules in favor of Sarah. Since Jack is the one who drafted the contract, the ambiguity in the clause is interpreted against his interests. In this case, the phrase ""to the best of their abilities"" is understood to mean that Jack's team has a responsibility to guarantee success, not just try their best.

As a result, Jack's company is held liable for Sarah's losses, as the court interprets the contract in a way that favors Sarah's interests. This ruling highlights the importance of Contra proferentem, demonstrating that ambiguities in contracts should be resolved in favor of the party not responsible for drafting the language."
Contributory negligence	"In some common law jurisdictions, contributory negligence is a defense to a tort claim based on negligence. If it is available, the defense completely bars plaintiffs from any recovery if they contribute to their own injury through their own negligence. 
Because the contributory negligence doctrine can lead to harsh results, many common law jurisdictions have abolished it in favor of a ""comparative fault"" or ""comparative negligence"" approach. A comparative negligence approach reduces the plaintiff's damages award by the percentage of fault the fact-finder assigns to the plaintiff for their own injury. For example, if a jury thinks the plaintiff is 30% at fault, the plaintiff's damages award will be reduced by 30%."	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of contributory negligence:

Sarah was waiting at a pedestrian crossing on a busy street when she was hit by a car. As she was gazing at her phone, she failed to watch the traffic lights and didn't hear the car approaching. She suffered serious injuries and brought a lawsuit against the driver.

However, during the investigation, it was discovered that Sarah had ignored the flashing warning lights and didn't make any effort to move to a safe location before being struck. In fact, a witness reported that Sarah was swaying in place and not paying attention to the road just before the accident.

The defense attorney argued that Sarah's own negligence contributed to the accident, citing her failure to follow pedestrian safety protocols. If the court ruled that Sarah's contributory negligence barred her from recovering any damages, she would receive nothing, despite the fact that the driver was also partially to blame.

On the other hand, if the court applied the comparative negligence approach, it might find that both Sarah and the driver shared fault. For example, if the jury determined that Sarah was 40% at fault for not heeding the warning lights, her damages award would be reduced by 40%. This approach ensures that the court still acknowledges the driver's responsibility for the accident while recognizing Sarah's role in exacerbating the harm."
Corporate opportunity	The corporate opportunity doctrine is the legal principle providing that directors, officers, and controlling shareholders of a corporation must not take for themselves any business opportunity that could benefit the corporation.  The corporate opportunity doctrine is one application of the fiduciary duty of loyalty.	"Meet Emma, a dedicated and passionate CEO of GreenTech, a sustainable energy company. Emma had spent years building the company from the ground up and had built a strong reputation within the industry for innovative solutions and community involvement.

One day, a local municipality approached Emma with a proposal to develop a large-scale solar farm on a plot of land the city owned. The project would not only provide clean energy to the community but also create jobs and stimulate local economic growth.

Unbeknownst to Emma, a friend and private equity investor, Alex, who had a controlling stake in GreenTech, had long been looking to expand his own portfolio into the renewable energy sector. Alex approached Emma with a proposal to partner on the solar farm project, insisting that he would handle the financial and operational aspects, allowing Emma to focus on her work at GreenTech.

Emma was tempted by the opportunity, but she remembered her fiduciary duties as a CEO. She realized that the solar farm project was a corporate opportunity that could benefit GreenTech, and it would be unfair to pursue it as a personal venture.

After some deliberation, Emma decided to decline Alex's offer and instead recommended to the GreenTech board that the company pursue the solar farm project. The board agreed, and GreenTech was awarded the contract. Emma's decision was hailed as a model of responsible corporate governance, demonstrating her commitment to the company's interests and reputation for transparency and integrity.

In this scenario, Emma's refusal to take the solar farm project for herself exemplified the corporate opportunity doctrine, demonstrating her loyalty to GreenTech and ensuring that the company's interests remained paramount."
Correlative rights doctrine	The correlative rights doctrine is a legal doctrine limiting the rights of landowners to a common source of groundwater (such as an aquifer) to a reasonable share, typically based on the amount of land owned by each on the surface above.  This doctrine is also applied to oil and gas in some U.S. states.	"**The Quiet Neighbor**

Sarah and her family have lived on their 5-acre farm in rural Texas for generations. They rely heavily on the water from a shared aquifer for irrigation and household use. Nearby, Tom owns 20 acres, which is mostly used for cattle grazing. Tom's land drains into the same aquifer.

For years, Sarah complained that Tom's extensive cattle operations were pumping a disproportionate amount of water, affecting the water table and reducing her supply. She claimed she couldn't sustain her farm without sufficient water. 

One day, Tom vastly increased his water pumping, concerned about his own supplemental irrigation needs. Tom stated that his land needed more water to feed his growing cattle operation. Tensions rose between the two landowners as Sarah's family started experiencing increasingly unreliable access to water. Desperate, Sarah requested that Tom limit his water usage to allow her access to a fair share.

A water rights expert helped mediate their disputes. Applying the correlative rights doctrine, the mediator found that each landowner was entitled to a reasonable share of the aquifer based on their respective land holdings. It was determined that Tom should use his land for the type and amount of water necessarily associated with its abuse. The mediator agreed with Sarah that Tom had expropriated an excessive amount of water necessary to oppose her share, denying her a fair correlative right to a basic living necessity. Tom's pumping levels were required to reach a balance that accommodated both parties, ensuring each party had a reasonable access to water under the aquifer.

There is a concept related to this.  impact of over-extraction"
Crumbling skull rule	"The crumbling skull rule is a well-established legal doctrine used in some tort law systems.  It holds that where a plaintiff had a condition or injury that predates the tort and would have naturally deteriorated or worsened over time (e.g. a crumbling skull), the defendant is not responsible to the degree that the condition or injury would have naturally worsened over time.  A defendant is only liable for the degree the injury was worsened or the hastening or acceleration of the damage caused by the tort.  The crumbling skull rule should not be confused with the related thin skull rule.
The concept is sometimes applied without specific reference to the crumbling skull rule, instead being expressed as a non-absolute application of the thin skull rule."	"Dr. Emma Taylor, a renowned orthopedic surgeon, had been diagnosed with early-onset osteoporosis in her late 30s. Despite her best efforts to manage the condition, her bones remained weak and brittle. One day, while walking down the street, Emma tripped and fell on a freshly poured concrete sidewalk that was not properly marked as a construction zone.

As a result of the fall, Emma suffered a serious fracture in her already weakened spine. She was rushed to the hospital and underwent emergency surgery. The surgery was successful, but the fracture had caused significant damage to her spinal cord, leading to permanent paralysis from the waist down.

Emma sued the construction company, alleging that their negligence in failing to provide adequate warning of the hazardous sidewalk had caused her injury. The company's lawyers argued that they were only responsible for the acceleration of Emma's condition, claiming that her pre-existing osteoporosis would have eventually caused her to suffer a spine fracture anyway.

The judge ruled in favor of the construction company, stating that Emma's condition would have naturally deteriorated over time and that the defendant was only liable for the hastening or acceleration of the damage caused by their negligence. Emma's lawyer argued that the thin skull rule applied, but the judge disagreed, citing the crumbling skull rule, which acknowledges that a plaintiff's pre-existing condition can affect the extent of their damages.

In the end, Emma received a smaller settlement than she had hoped for, as the court limited her damages to the extent to which the construction company had accelerated her condition. The case highlights the crumbling skull rule's application in real-life scenarios, where pre-existing conditions play a significant role in determining damages."
Dangerous proximity doctrine	"The dangerous proximity doctrine is an American standard for distinguishing between preparation and attempt in a criminal case.: 683  Under this standard, evidence that preparatory acts are an actual attempt is considered to be stronger if the offense is more probable and more grave or serious; if the defendant is nearer to completing the intended crime; and if the defendant's acts are likely to lead to the commission of the crime.: 683  However, the standard is not a clear bright line.

"	"The sun was setting on the small town of Oakdale, casting a golden glow over the quiet streets. 25-year-old Maria had always been fascinated by the world of high-stakes poker. She had spent countless hours online, learning tricks of the trade, and even attending a few underground games in her early twenties. That was until she got caught by the law and had her winning streak put on hold.

Fast forward a few years, Maria was back, but this time with a plan. She had found a website that promised a chance to win big, and she was convinced she had the skills to beat the competition. She began to gather her gear, from poker tables to high-tech software, carefully building her crime, preparing for the biggest heist of her life.

One fateful night, as Maria sat hunched in front of her laptop, her crime was near completion. The last piece of the puzzle, the encryption software, was all she needed. And then, just as she was about to crack the code, the police burst in, guns drawn, and arrested her on the spot.

In this case, Maria's acts were deemed ""dangerous proximity"" to the actual crime. Her months of preparation, her stash of equipment, and her proximity to the online poker game at the time of the arrest all pointed to an attempt, rather than mere intent. The court ruled that Maria's actions had crossed the line from preparation to attempt, and she was charged accordingly. Maria's case exemplified the dangers of getting too close to the crime."
Demise of the Crown	"Demise of the Crown is the legal term in the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms for the transfer of the Crown upon the death or abdication of the monarch. The Crown transfers automatically to the monarch's heir. The concept evolved in the kingdom of England, and was continued in Great Britain and then the United Kingdom. The concept also became part of the constitutions of the British colonies, and was continued in the constitutions of the Commonwealth realms, until modified within those realms.
Originally, the demise of the Crown in England had significant legal effects: individuals who had been appointed to office by the deceased monarch lost their positions; if Parliament was sitting, it automatically dissolved; and actions in the royal courts automatically discontinued and had to be re-started. Almost all of these legal effects have been abolished by statutes of the British Parliament and the parliaments of the Commonwealth realms, so that the demise of the Crown no longer has much legal significance.
Although the concept of the demise of the Crown originally was based on the monarch's death, it was used in 1936 to describe the transfer of the Crown to George VI upon the abdication of Edward VIII, as the Act of Parliament that gave legal effect to the abdication specified that, upon the instrument of abdication taking effect, Edward VIII would cease to be King and there would be a demise of the Crown.
Other monarchies use different terminologies for the end of a reign.
If the monarch who dies or abdicates is the Queen and her successor is the King, references to 'Queen's' automatically changes to 'King's'. For example, lawyers in the Dominions of the Crown who are Queen's Counsel (Q.C.) at the time of the demise become King's Counsel (K.C.) without any need to seek new letters patent. The reverse is also true, as was the case from 6 February 1952 upon the death of King George VI, when living King's Counsel became Queen's Counsel.

"	"As she heard the news of Queen Elizabeth's passing, Lady Smith felt a mix of emotions. She had been a Queen's Counsel, the highest honor for a barrister in the United Kingdom, for over a decade. She had advised the Queen on numerous matters and was proud to bear the title.

But, she wondered, what would happen to her position now? Would she still be entitled to the title and privileges that came with it? According to ancient tradition, the demise of the Crown meant that all appointments made by the deceased monarch were null and void.

However, as she poured over legal documents, Lady Smith discovered that the law had evolved over the years. The demise of the Crown no longer had significant legal effects. Her title as Queen's Counsel was automatically transferred to King Charles, the new monarch, without the need for any formalities.

Lady Smith was relieved and grateful for this change. She would continue to be a respected lawyer, but now as King's Counsel. The news also brought a sense of continuity and stability to the legal profession. It was reassuring to know that, despite the changing of the guard, the unwavering tradition of the British monarch continued uninterrupted.

As she contemplated her new role, Lady Smith felt a sense of excitement and responsibility. She was proud to serve under King Charles, preserving the time-honored traditions of the Queen's Council while embracing the future of the legal profession. The demise of the Crown, once a complex and intricate process, had become a mere formality, ensuring a seamless transition to a new era."
Desuetude	"In law, desuetude (; from French  désuétude, from Latin  desuetudo 'outdated, no longer custom') is a doctrine that causes statutes, similar legislation, or legal principles to lapse and become unenforceable by a long habit of non-enforcement or lapse of time.  It is what happens to laws that are not repealed when they become obsolete.  It is the legal doctrine that long and continued non-use of a law renders it invalid, at least in the sense that courts will no longer tolerate punishing its transgressors.
The policy of inserting sunset clauses into a constitution or charter of rights (as in Canada since 1982) or into regulations and other delegated/subordinate legislation made under an act (as in Australia since the early 1990s) can be regarded as a statutory codification of this jus commune doctrine."	"It's 1950 in the small town of Willow Creek. The streets are lined with old oak trees, and the smell of freshly baked cookies wafts from the local bakery. The law that has governed the town for decades is a peculiar one – a 1809 statute that requires all residents to wear a hat to church on Sundays.

For generations, the townsfolk have complacently ignored this law, and the town's authorities have similarly turned a blind eye. The mayor reasons that such an outdated law is no longer relevant to modern life, and the town's money would be better spent on more pressing issues. As the years go by, the law becomes a laughingstock, and no one even remembers the last time someone was fined for not wearing a hat.

One Sunday, a young couple, Alice and Jack, walk into church without hats. The town's bylaw officer, Mr. Jenkins, is still duty-bound to enforce the law, but after a glance at the couple, he shrugs and says, ""Ah, I guess we just haven't gotten around to doing that in a while."" The duo is let off with a warning, and the story becomes a inside joke among the townsfolk.

Over time, the town council realizes that this law is no longer enforceable or meaningful. They decide to officially repeal it, citing the doctrine of desuetude – the idea that a law becomes obsolete when it's no longer enforced and collecting dust. From then on, the townspeople are free to attend church without the burden of a hat. The law is finally laid to rest, a relic of a bygone era."
Discovery doctrine	The discovery doctrine, or doctrine of discovery, is a disputed interpretation of international law during the Age of Discovery, introduced into United States municipal law by the US Supreme Court Justice John Marshall in Johnson v. McIntosh (1823). In Marshall's formulation of the doctrine, discovery of territory previously unknown to Europeans gave the discovering nation title to that territory against all other European nations, and this title could be perfected by possession. A number of legal scholars have criticized Marshall's interpretation of the relevant international law. In recent decades, advocates for Indigenous rights have campaigned against the doctrine, which purportedly stemmed from some Papal bulls. In 2023, the Roman Curia of the Vatican formally repudiated the doctrine.	"In the autumn of 1492, Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazano set foot on the eastern coast of what is now North Carolina. He claimed the land for his patron, King Ferdinand of Spain, and marked the territory with a cross.

Decades later, in 1620, English colonists established the Plymouth Colony on the same coast. As the English and Spanish had a longstanding dispute over American territories, the question arose: which nation held rightful ownership to the land?

One day, a dispute arose between a group of English settlers and a Spanish merchant who had settled on lands nearby. They both claimed the territory as their own, citing the discovery doctrine. According to this doctrine, Giovanni da Verrazano's discovery of the land gave Spain title to the territory, which could be perfected by possession.

The settlers were perplexed, but their local lawyer, a clever man named John, saw an opportunity. He argued that the doctrine was never intended to displace the rights of Indigenous peoples, who had inhabited the land for centuries. Furthermore, John pointed out that the Papal bulls, which granted European powers the right to explore and colonize non-Christian lands, were not meant to be taken literally.

Thanks to John's expertise, the dispute was settled in favor of the English settlers. Though the discovery doctrine had once seemed unshakeable, it was ultimately recognized as a flawed interpretation of international law. This laid the groundwork for future negotiations between European powers and Indigenous peoples, seeking a more just resolution to long-standing disputes."
Doctrine of cash equivalence	"The Doctrine of Cash Equivalence states that the U.S. Federal income tax law treats certain non-cash payment transactions like cash payment transactions for federal income tax purposes. The doctrine is used most often for deciding when cash method (as opposed to accrual method) taxpayers are to include certain non-cash income items.  Another doctrine often used when trying to determine the timing of the inclusion of income is the constructive receipt doctrine.
Most individuals begin as cash method taxpayers because their first form of bookkeeping is a checkbook. In contrast, some businesses start as accrual method taxpayers because businesses use different rules for recording income and expenditures. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) § 446(a) states, however, that  ""[t]axable income shall be computed under the method of accounting on the basis which the taxpayer regularly computes his income in keeping his books.""
One of the major advantages to the cash method of accounting is the ability to defer taxation because the recognition of income applicable to amounts in accounts receivable can be deferred to a later year. The Doctrine of Cash Equivalence is important because many people are cash method taxpayers and would be subject to this rule.

"	"Meet Sarah, a freelance graphic designer who operates her business as a cash method taxpayer. She has a few regular clients who pay her through PayPal, and she keeps track of her income by checking her account balances regularly. Sarah's tax preparer, Rachel, advises her to use the cash method because it's easier for her to keep track of her income and expenses.

One day, Sarah lands a big project with a corporate client, who agrees to pay her $10,000 over several months. Sarah delivers her work as promised, but the client requests that she hold onto the funds until they complete a few additional modifications. Sarah puts the payment into a holding account, intending to release it when the modifications are finished.

According to the Doctrine of Cash Equivalence, even though Sarah hasn't physically received the cash, she's treated as having received income in the year she earns it. This is because the payment is essentially ""equivalent to cash"" – she can use the funds in her holding account as if she had received them in her hands. As a cash method taxpayer, Sarah must recognize the $10,000 as income in the year she earns it, even though the client hasn't yet paid her. This is because the payment is already in her grasp, so to speak.

Had Sarah been an accrual method taxpayer, she might have delayed recognizing income until the year the client paid her the remaining installments. But as a cash method taxpayer, she must recognize the income when it becomes ""constructively received,"" which in this case is when she holds the payment in her account. Sarah's tax preparer, Rachel, helps her navigate this rule to ensure she accurately reports her income and takes advantage of the cash method's benefits."
Doctrine of chances	"In law, the doctrine of chances is a rule of evidence that allows evidence to show that it is unlikely a defendant would be repeatedly, innocently involved in similar, suspicious circumstances.
Normally, under Federal Rule of Evidence 404, evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.
Using the doctrine of chances allows a prosecutor to admit evidence of prior ""accidents"" that can persuade a jury that prior incidents are so similar that it is very improbable that the case at bar is actually accidental.
The doctrine of chances was first developed by English courts in the case Rex v. Smith, 11 Cr. App. R. 229, 84 L.J.K.B. 2153 (1915), better known as the ""brides in the bath murder"". In this case the defendant was accused of murdering his wife by drowning her in a bath. The defendant claimed that his wife had fainted in the bath. The prosecutor sought to include evidence in the trial that the defendant's two previous wives had both died in the same way. The evidence was allowed."	"Meet Emily, a successful businesswoman in her late 30s. She's known for her impeccable taste and love for luxury cars. Over the past few years, Emily has been involved in a series of unfortunate accidents, each involving her pride and joy - her Mercedes S-Class. In 2015, Emily's car was rear-ended on a busy highway, causing minor damage. A year later, her car skidded off the road and got stuck in a mud pit while she was driving home from a late night event. Most recently, Emily's car caught fire while parked in her driveway, causing significant damage.

The police are now investigating the latest incident, and Emily's insurance company is raising suspicions. They're wondering if Emily's series of accidents are mere coincidence or if there's something more sinister at play. The prosecutor wants to present evidence of the previous accidents to show that it's unlikely for these mishaps to happen without some intention or negligence on Emily's part.

In this case, the doctrine of chances comes into play. By presenting evidence of the prior accidents, the prosecution can persuade the jury that it's highly improbable that these incidents are independent events. The jury may conclude that Emily's actions are not simply the result of bad luck, but rather a pattern of behavior that indicates a higher likelihood of involvement in the latest incident.

Emily's defense team, on the other hand, will argue that each accident was a genuine mistake, and the coincidence of similar incidents is simply that - a coincidence. The jury must weigh the evidence and decide whether Emily's actions are extraordinary or within the bounds of normal human error."
Doctrine of colourability	"The doctrine of colourability is the idea that when a legislature wants to do something that it cannot do within the constraints of its government's constitution, it colours the law with a substitute purpose, allowing it to accomplish its original goal.

"	"Meet Sarah, a passionate environmental activist who has been fighting to protect her local park from rampant development. The park, which is a vital green space for the community, has been in the crosshairs of a wealthy real estate developer who wants to build a luxury resort on the land.

The local government, in a bid to appease the developer, passes a new ordinance ostensibly meant to ""improve public safety."" The ordinance requires that any outdoor recreational space, including the park, be equipped with ""enhanced security cameras"" and ""additional perimeter fencing."" However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that these ""security measures"" are nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to restrict public access to the park and pave the way for the resort's construction.

Sarah discovers that the ordinance is actually a clever ploy by the government to ""colour"" its unconstitutional actions, allowing it to skirt the local constitution's protections for public parks. The legislation's proponents argue that the ordinance is necessary to boost public safety, but Sarah suspects a more nefarious motive.

Sarah decides to challenge the ordinance in court, claiming that it is actually a subterfuge to abdicate the government's responsibilities to protect the park. The court ultimately agrees, ruling that the ordinance is an attempt to ""colour"" the government's desire to develop the park with a substitute purpose of improving public safety, when in reality, it serves the developer's interest. The ruling invalidates the ordinance, and Sarah's efforts to protect the park are vindicated.

This scenario illustrates how the doctrine of colourability can be used to sidestep constitutional limitations and achieve a desired outcome. By creating a plausible substitute purpose, government officials can manipulate the law to achieve their goals, while appearing to be acting within the bounds of the constitution."
Doctrine of equivalents	"The doctrine of equivalents is a legal rule in many (but not all) of the world's patent systems that allows a court to hold a party liable for patent infringement if the infringing device or process does not fall within the literal scope of a patent claim but is nevertheless equivalent to the claimed invention. In the United States, Judge Learned Hand has described its purpose as being ""to temper unsparing logic and prevent an infringer from stealing the benefit of the invention."""	"Meet Emma, a talented chef and food entrepreneur. She spent years developing a unique recipe for artisanal vegan granola bars. Emma patented her recipe, which included a specific combination of ingredients, a unique baking process, and a proprietary blend of spices.

After Emma's business took off, a competitor, Alex, started selling a competing product that differed from Emma's recipe in several ways. Alex's bars used a different type of nut, a different sweetener, and a different baking temperature. At first glance, it seemed like Alex's product didn't infringe on Emma's patent.

However, when Emma learned about Alex's product, she realized that the competitor's bars had a similar texture, taste, and nutritional content to hers. After conducting further research, Emma discovered that the baking process Alex used was strikingly similar to her own, and the proprietary blend of spices was seemingly identical.

Emma took legal action against Alex, citing patent infringement. In court, a judge applied the doctrine of equivalents, recognizing that while Alex's product didn't exactly match Emma's patent claims, it was equivalent to her invention in terms of its functionality and overall impact. The judge ruled in Emma's favor, holding Alex liable for patent infringement.

In this scenario, the doctrine of equivalents helped Emma protect her intellectual property and prevented Alex from ""stealing the benefit"" of her invention. The doctrine recognizes that an infringer can't simply modify an invention to avoid infringement by using similar but not identical components or processes, as long as the final product achieves the same purpose and effect as the original invention."
Doctrine of exoneration of liens	"The doctrine of exoneration of liens (sometimes simply referred to as ""doctrine of exoneration"") refers to a common law rule. The rule says that encumbrances (i.e. a mortgage) of a property conveyed by a will is discharged with funds from the originating estate, not from the property itself."	"Meet Emily, who inherited a beautiful family home from her late aunt. The property, which was the only asset in her aunt's estate, was still subject to a mortgage that her aunt had taken out many years ago to pay for home renovations. The loan was now fully paid off, but the mortgage remained as a lien on the property.

Emily's aunt had left the property in her will to Emily, but the will made no mention of the mortgage. Emily was worried about how she would handle the mortgage, as she had no intention of living in the house itself. She decided to sell the property and use the proceeds to pay off her own debts.

As she was preparing to sell the property, Emily's lawyer informed her that the doctrine of exoneration of liens applied to her situation. This meant that the mortgage was being paid off using the funds from her aunt's estate, rather than the property itself. Emily was relieved to know that she wouldn't have to worry about taking on the mortgage herself.

On the day of the sale, the proceeds from the sale of the property were used to pay off the mortgage, along with other debts and expenses from her aunt's estate. Emily was left with a clean slate, free from any burden of the mortgage or other liens. She was grateful for the doctrine of exoneration of liens, which allowed her to inherit a property without being saddled with unwanted responsibilities."
Doctrine of foreign equivalents	"This article discusses the trademark doctrine regarding translation of foreign words. For the patent doctrine regarding equivalent means to practice an invention, see Doctrine of equivalents.

The doctrine of foreign equivalents is a rule applied in United States trademark law which requires courts and the TTAB to translate foreign words in determining whether they are registrable as trademarks, or confusingly similar with existing marks. The doctrine is intended to protect consumers within the United States from confusion or deception caused by the use of terms in different languages. In some cases, a party will use a word as a mark which is either generic or merely descriptive of the goods in a foreign language, or which shares the same meaning as an existing mark to speakers of that foreign language.

"	"Imagine a new coffee shop, ""Café Tortuga,"" opening up in a trendy neighborhood in New York City. The name is catchy and exotic, and the owners claim that it means ""Tortoise"" in Spanish. They propagate this as a clever play on their slow-and-steady approach to serving high-quality coffee.

However, a well-established Mexican restaurant across town, El Cuate, notices the similarity between the names and feels deceived. They argue that ""Tortuga"" is indeed a Spanish word for ""turtle"" or ""tortoise"" in Mexico, where their target audience is predominantly Spanish-speaking customers. According to El Cuate, the name ""Café Tortuga"" is likely to confuse their customers and dilute their own brand.

To resolve the dispute, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) is called upon. Under the doctrine of foreign equivalents, the TTAB must translate both words and determine if they are confusingly similar. After analysis, the board concludes that both names mean the same thing in their respective Spanish-speaking contexts and could cause consumer confusion.

As a result, the TTAB denies the registration of ""Café Tortuga"" as a trademark, citing that the name is likely to cause confusion with the established brand, El Cuate. This illustrates the doctrine of foreign equivalents, where courts and the TTAB consider translation to ensure that consumers are protected from deceptive or confusing trademarks."
Doctrine of indivisibility	"The doctrine of indivisibility (or indivisibility doctrine) was a legal doctrine in United States copyright law, which held that a copyright was a single, indivisible right that its owner could only assign as a whole.  The doctrine was founded upon the policy concern that a defendant alleged to have infringed a single work might find himself facing claims from multiple plaintiffs, all claiming copyright in that same work.  Despite the indivisibility doctrine, a copyright holder could still effectively assign certain rights.  The assignees of those rights were held to be ""mere licensees.""
This doctrine could yield a harsh result for an exclusive licensee in a work.  If a third party infringed the work, the copyright holder had no motivation to file suit---the work was no longer marketable.  So courts allowed exclusive licensees to compulsively join the copyright holder as a plaintiff in such suits.  Non-exclusive licensees could not forcefully join copyright holders, on the theory that in those cases, the work was still marketable and the copyright holder therefore had an interest in protecting his rights.
The doctrine could also yield a harsh result where a magazine purchased the right of first publication from an author, but provided a copyright notice only for the magazine as a whole, not for the author. This would result in a forfeiture of any copyright protection and an injection of the work into the public domain. As detailed below, this harsh result was mostly abrogated by Goodis v. United Artists Television, Inc.
In the case Goodis v. United Artists Television, Inc., 425 F.2d 397, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the doctrine of indivisibility could not operate to wholly deprive an author of his copyright when a ""mere licensee"" secured a copyright in a collective work but the author never secured a separate copyright on his own.
The doctrine of indivisibility was expressly eliminated in the Copyright Act of 1976. Assignees of rights in a copyrighted work now have standing to directly file suit against infringers. Because adequacy of a copyright notice is examined under the statue as it existed on the date that the work was first published, the doctrine of indivisibility remains potentially relevant for works published before January 1, 1978."	"Here's a short story that illustrates the doctrine of indivisibility:

It's 1960, and renowned photographer, Emma Taylor, agrees to partner with renowned publisher, Modern Times Magazine, to feature her iconic portfolio in their upcoming issue. Emma signs an exclusive contract with Modern Times, granting them the rights to publish her photographs. In return, Modern Times provides Emma with a modest advance and promises to give her a byline.

When the issue hits newsstands, Modern Times surprisingly doesn't include a copyright notice for Emma's photos, only for the magazine as a whole. Unbeknownst to Emma, Modern Times doesn't bother to register their copyright either.

Months later, a rival publication, appropriately named ""Rival Times,"" decides to steal Emma's portfolio and reproduce it in their own magazine without permission. When Emma discovers the infringement, she's devastated. Since Modern Times hasn't registered their copyright, Emma realizes she has no rights to file a lawsuit against Rival Times.

This is where the doctrine of indivisibility comes into play. Because Modern Times holds the copyright to the entire magazine, including Emma's portfolio, Emma is technically a ""mere licensee"" and cannot file a lawsuit on her own. The court would require her to join forces with Modern Times as co-plaintiffs.

Emma's frustration grows as she realizes Modern Times is unwilling to take action, fearing that the lawsuit would harm their reputation and make the magazine unmarketable. This harsh result highlights the pitfalls of the doctrine of indivisibility, where a copyright holder's inaction can lead to the forfeiture of an author's rights."
Doctrine of inherency	"In United States patent law, the doctrine of inherency holds that, under certain circumstances, prior art may be relied upon not only for what it expressly teaches, but also for what is inherent therein, i.e., what necessarily flows from the express teachings. For a patent claim to be valid, its subject-matter must be novel and non-obvious. The claim is anticipated (i.e. will fail because its subject-matter is not novel) if a single prior art reference, either expressly or inherently, discloses every feature of the claimed invention. The concept of inherency is predicated on the idea that a claim should not pass the test of anticipation merely because a feature of it is undisclosed or unrecognized in the prior art reference. A prior art source may thus still anticipate if an apparently missing element of the claim is inherent in that prior art source.
Procedurally, to rely on the doctrine of inherency, one must provide a basis in fact and/or technical reasoning supporting a determination that an allegedly inherent characteristic necessarily would be present if the teachings of the prior art were followed, even if the inherent feature would not have been recognized.
The fact that a certain result or characteristic may occur or be present in the prior art is not alone sufficient to establish the inherency of that result or characteristic. To establish inherency, the evidence must make clear that the missing matter is necessarily present in the prior art reference.  Inherency may not be established by probabilities or possibilities.
Once the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) establishes that a product referenced in prior art appears to be substantially identical, the burden shifts to the applicant to show a non-obvious difference.
The doctrine of inherency is typically invoked when an inventor tries to obtain a product patent for a product that had been unintentionally invented earlier (""accidental anticipation"").
The United States Supreme Court held in Tilghman v. Proctor that where the first, accidental producer was not aware of the product and did not attempt to produce it, the first production did not bar a patent on the subsequent ""invention"" of the product. 102 U.S. 707 (1880).
The use of the doctrine of inherency in a determination of obviousness is more complicated because ""[t]hat which may be inherent is not necessarily known and that which is unknown cannot be obvious.""
A patent applicant may use the doctrine of inherency to respond to a rejection for lack of an adequate written description by showing that the patent application inherently includes the disclosure that is allegedly lacking."	"Meet Emma, a talented baker who wants to patent her new recipe for a gluten-free, vegan chocolate cake. As she's preparing her patent application, she receives a notice from the USPTO stating that her application has been rejected due to prior art. Specifically, a similar recipe was published online several years ago, albeit without the exact same ingredients and method.

Emma's first instinct is to think that she's still safe since the prior art recipe doesn't match her exact recipe. However, the USPTO argues that the doctrine of inherency applies. According to them, since the prior art recipe mentions using common baking techniques and substitutes for gluten and dairy, it's inherent that a baker familiar with those techniques would naturally substitute those ingredients to create a gluten-free, vegan cake.

The USPTO claims that it's obvious to combine the teachings of the prior art recipe with basic baking knowledge to arrive at an identical recipe. Emma argues that it wasn't clear to her, and maybe not to others, exactly how to substitute those ingredients without re-inventing the wheel. But the USPTO insists that if a skilled baker followed the prior art recipe, they would necessarily arrive at Emma's exact cake.

Emma must now prove that her cake is not obvious in relation to the prior art. She will need to provide convincing evidence that her cake involves more than just a combination of well-known techniques and ingredients, and demonstrate that a skilled baker would not have necessarily arrived at her exact recipe through the prior art alone. The doctrine of inherency has turned Emma's straightforward patent application into a complex legal battle."
Doctrine of international exhaustion	"The exhaustion of intellectual property rights constitutes one of the limits of intellectual property (IP) rights. Once a given product has been sold under the authorization of the IP owner, the reselling, rental, lending and other third party commercial uses of IP-protected goods in domestic and international markets are governed by the principle.
After a product covered by an IP right, such as by a patent right, has been sold by the IP right owner or by others with the consent of the owner, the IP right is said to be exhausted. It can no longer be exercised by the owner. This limitation is also referred to as the exhaustion doctrine or first sale doctrine. For example, if an inventor obtains a patent on a new kind of umbrella, the inventor (or anyone else to whom he sells his patent) can legally prohibit other companies from making and selling this kind of umbrella, but cannot prohibit customers who have bought this umbrella from the patent owner from reselling the umbrella to third parties. Or if a piece of software containing a patented algorithm is distributed by the patent owner, then the patent is exhausted.
While there is a ""fairly broad consensus"" throughout the world that patent exhaustion ""applies at least within the context of the domestic market"", ""[t]here is less consensus as to what extent the sale of an IP protected product abroad can exhaust the IP rights over this product in the context of domestic law."" The former is the concept of ""national exhaustion"", the latter of ""regional exhaustion"" or ""international exhaustion"". The rules and legal implications of the exhaustion largely differ depending on the country of importation, i.e. the national jurisdiction.
The legal concept of international exhaustion is much more controversial, and is recognized in some countries but not in others. The importation, in a country that recognizes the concept of international exhaustion, of a product sold in a foreign country with the authorization of the IP right owner cannot be prevented by the IP right owner. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), an international agreement administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO), does not address the issue of exhaustion of intellectual property rights.
Brexit in 2020 caused restrictions on trade out of the UK, creating an asymmetric exhaustion status enabling imports to the UK from the EEA where there is no matching opportunity for parallel exports from the UK to the EEA. This was thought in February 2022 to be likely to continue for some time, or even indefinitely."	"As the manager of a small retail store in the United States, Sarah had always struggled to keep up with the latest trends from London. She loved the fashion-forward clothing sold by British brands, but the import process was so complicated that she usually ended up paying a premium for goods that were already available at a lower price in the UK.

One day, Sarah stumbled upon a shipment of designer handbags from a British company, legally sold in the European Union with the owner's consent. The distributor assured her that these bags were not restricted from resale in the US market. Sarah couldn't believe her luck and swiftly ordered a large shipment.

However, when the bags arrived, the director of the British fashion brand suddenly contacted Sarah, demanding that she return the handbags and refrain from selling them in the US. The brand claimed that international exhaustion laws didn't apply, and they still held exclusive rights over these bags.

Sarah was taken aback. She knew that in the US, exhaustion doctrine applied, and once the bags were sold legally in one country, they could be resold without restriction. But what about international sales? Did the British brand's consent to sell these bags in the EU mean that they couldn't be sold anywhere else, including in the US?

This situation illustrates the controversy surrounding international exhaustion. While some countries recognize that once a product is sold abroad with the owner's consent, the owner's rights are exhausted, others don't. In this case, the outcome hinged on whether the US recognized international exhaustion, and what the implications would be for Sarah's store and her customers."
Doctrine of laches	"In common-law legal systems, laches ( LAT-chiz, ;  Law French: remissness, dilatoriness, from Old French: laschesse) is a lack of diligence and activity in making a legal claim, or moving forward with legal enforcement of a right, particularly in regard to  equity. It is an unreasonable delay that can be viewed as prejudicing the opposing party. When asserted in litigation, it is an equity defense, that is, a defense to a claim for an equitable remedy.  It is often understood in comparison to a statute of limitations, a statutory defense, which traditionally is a defense to a claim ""at law"".
The person invoking laches is asserting that an opposing party has ""slept on its rights"", and that, as a result of this delay, circumstances have changed (witnesses or evidence may have been lost or no longer available, etc.), such that it is no longer a just resolution to grant the plaintiff's claim. Laches is associated with the maxim of equity: ""Equity aids the vigilant"" – not those who sleep on their rights. Put another way, failure to assert one's rights in a timely manner can result in a claim being barred by laches."	"Here is a short story that illustrates the doctrine of laches:

Rachel and her family had a small parcel of land that bordered a large development project. In the early days of the project, Rachel's family and the developers had a verbal agreement that the developers would not build too close to their property. However, as the project progressed and the developers began building high-rise condos, Rachel's family started to feel the impact of the increased noise and traffic.

In 2010, Rachel's family asked the developers to abide by the agreed-upon buffer zone, but the developers refused, claiming that it was no longer feasible to modify their plans. Rachel's family decided to take legal action to stop the construction, but they never filed a lawsuit.

Years went by, and the project was completed. In the meantime, Rachel's family sold the property to a new owner, who had no knowledge of the original verbal agreement. When the new owner started experiencing similar issues with the noise and traffic, they contacted the developers, who pointed out that the project had already been completed and the agreed-upon buffer zone was no longer relevant.

In response, the new owner argued that Rachel's family had ""slept on their rights"" and failed to assert their claim in a timely manner. They claimed that the delay had prejudiced them, as the original developers were no longer a viable party to the dispute. The court ultimately ruled in favor of the new owner, holding that Rachel's family had lost their right to seek equitable relief due to their unreasonable delay."
Doctrine of necessity	"The doctrine of necessity is the basis on which extraordinary actions by administrative authority, which are designed to restore order or uphold fundamental constitutional principles, are considered to be lawful even if such an action contravenes established constitution, laws, norms, or conventions. The maxim on which the doctrine is based originated in the writings of the medieval jurist Henry de Bracton, and similar justifications for this kind of extra-legal action have been advanced by more recent legal authorities, including William Blackstone.
In a controversial 1954 judgment, Pakistani Chief Justice Muhammad Munir validated the extra-constitutional use of emergency powers by Governor General, Ghulam Mohammad. In his judgment, the Chief Justice cited Bracton's maxim, 'that which is otherwise not lawful is made lawful by necessity', thereby providing the label that would come to be attached to the judgment and the doctrine that it was establishing.
The doctrine of necessity may also refer to the necessity of a judge with a reasonable apprehension of bias continuing to decide a matter if there is no alternative to that judge. The Supreme Court of Canada applied this doctrine in the 1998 Reference re Remuneration of Judges (No 2) case.

"	"Title: A Necessary Course of Action

In a small town in rural America, a severe ice storm struck, leaving thousands of residents without power, heat, or access to basic necessities like food and water. The local government, struggling to respond to the crisis, declared a state of emergency. As the situation escalated, the town's mayor, tired of bureaucratic red tape and inefficiency, took an extraordinary step: she requisitioned private buildings, schools, hospitals, and other public facilities to serve as temporary shelters for the affected community.

The move was contested by local business owners, claiming the mayor had overstepped her powers. However, in a subsequent court judgment, the doctrine of necessity was applied, validating the mayor's actions as lawful and justified by the extraordinary circumstances. The court ruled that the mayor had acted reasonably to restore order and maintain public safety, and that the emergency situation had created a situation of ""equivalency"" where the usual rules and procedures no longer applied.

In this scenario, the doctrine of necessity allowed the mayor to take extraordinary measures to address the emergency, even though they might have otherwise been considered unlawful. The ruling recognized that in times of crisis, extraordinary actions may be necessary to uphold fundamental constitutional principles, such as the protection of public health and safety. This legal concept serves as a safeguard, permitting authorities to respond effectively to unexpected situations while balancing the need for order with the protection of individual rights."
Doctrine of non-derogation from grants	"The doctrine of non-derogation from grants is a principle of the law of England and Wales. As the House of Lords explained in British Leyland Motor Corp v Armstrong Patents Co, it states that a seller of realty or goods is not permitted to take any action (such as bringing an infringement action) that will lessen the value to the buyer of the thing sold.
United States federal law recognises similar doctrines such as the exhaustion doctrine or doctrine of implied license. A similar effect has also been realised in United States patent law under the doctrine of repair and reconstruction.
An important difference between the doctrine of non-derogation from grants and other doctrines, particularly implied license, that are used to accomplish similar results is that the doctrine of non-derogation from grants is ""inherent"" as a matter of property law and apparently cannot be avoided by a seller's use of language attempting to negative application of the doctrine or by trial counsel's pointing to evidence of intent not to relinquish patent rights or copyright. In contrast, the other doctrines may be vulnerable to contractual disclaimers or evidence of intent not to grant intellectual property rights. The issue is discussed to some extent in the courts' opinions in British Leyland and Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc."	"Meet Emma, a crafty entrepreneur who owns a small bakery, ""Sweet Delights."" Emma has a secret recipe for the fluffiest, most divine croissants in town. To protect her recipes, Emma has them patented by the ""Croissant Patent Co."" (CPC).

One day, Emma's best friend, Alex, a talented pastry chef, wants to open his own bakery, ""Alex's Bakery."" Emma wants to help Alex, but she's concerned about the intellectual property risks. Emma and Alex decide to create a partnership, where Emma will sell Alex the rights to use her patented recipe for a one-time fee.

Their agreement includes a clause stating that Alex will not use the recipe for any other business or share it with anyone else. Emma thinks she's covered her bases, but unbeknownst to her, Alex has other plans.

To gain an unfair advantage, Alex starts selling his croissants at a lower price than Emma's, undercutting her business. Emma discovers this and threatens to take legal action against Alex, citing the patent infringement. However, the courts rule in favor of Alex, citing the doctrine of non-derogation from grants. The judges argue that by selling the recipe to Alex, Emma is not allowed to take any action that would lessen the value of the recipe to Alex – in this case, by trying to shut down his business.

Emma is now limited to enforcing the agreement and ensuring Alex doesn't share the recipe with others. If Emma tries to take more drastic measures, she'd be violating the doctrine of non-derogation from grants, essentially harming her own interests."
Doctrine of privity	"The doctrine of privity of contract is a common law principle which provides that a contract cannot confer rights or impose obligations upon anyone who is not a party to that contract. It is related to, but distinct from, the doctrine of consideration, according to which a promise is legally enforceable only if valid consideration has been provided for it, and a plaintiff is legally entitled to enforce such a promise only if they are a promisee from whom the consideration has moved.
A principal consequence of the doctrine of privity is that, at common law, a third party generally has no right to enforce a contract to which they are not a party, even where that contract was entered into by the contracting parties specifically for their benefit and with a common intention among all of them that they should be able to enforce it.  In England & Wales and Northern Ireland, the doctrine has been substantially weakened by the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, which created a statutory exception to privity, providing, in certain circumstances, third parties the right to enforce terms of contracts to which they are not privy."	"John and Sarah, a couple, wanted to ensure their children's inheritance after they passed away. They decided to create a trust, naming their children as beneficiaries. The trust required the couple's estate to pay for their children's university education expenses.

The couple approached their lawyer to draft the trust agreement. The lawyer included a clause stating that the children would be entitled to receive education expenses from their parents' estate. The couple and the children were all aware of the agreement, and the couple intended to benefit their children through this arrangement.

Years later, the couple passed away, and their estate was distributed according to the trust agreement. The children received funds to cover their university education expenses. However, when the children wanted to claim additional funds to cover living expenses not originally specified in the trust agreement, the estate administrator refused, citing the doctrine of privity.

The children were disappointed, but not surprised. They realized that, according to the common law, as they were not party to the original contract between their parents and the lawyer, they had no right to enforce the agreement. The doctrine of privity meant that the contract was only between the contracting parties (the couple and the lawyer), and the children were not entitled to any benefits under the agreement, even though they were the intended beneficiaries.

This story illustrates the doctrine of privity, where a third party (the children) cannot enforce a contract (the trust agreement) to which they are not a party, even if the contract is made for their benefit and with their knowledge."
Doctrine of repair and reconstruction	"The doctrine of repair and reconstruction in United States patent law distinguishes between permissible repair of a patented article, which the right of an owner of property to preserve its utility and operability guarantees, and impermissible reconstruction of a patented article, which is patent infringement. The doctrine is explained in Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co. The Aro case states the rule in these terms:

The decisions of this Court require the conclusion that reconstruction of a patented entity, comprised of unpatented elements, is limited to such a true reconstruction of the entity as to ""in fact make a new article,"" after the entity, viewed as a whole, has become spent. In order to call the monopoly, conferred by the patent grant, into play for a second time, it must, indeed, be a second creation of the patented entity. …Mere replacement of individual unpatented parts, one at a time, whether of the same part repeatedly or different parts successively, is no more than the lawful right of the owner to repair his property.

An extension  of the doctrine is a right to modify the product to enhance its functionality, such as to make it operate faster or with a different size of product. The Supreme Court said in Wilbur-Ellis Co. v. Kuther that such a right was ""kin  to repair for it bore on the useful capacity of the old combination, on which the royalty had been paid.""
The House of Lords declared a similar principle—the doctrine of non-derogation from grants—concerning car owners' repair and replacement of automobile parts, in British Leyland Motor Corp. v. Armstrong Patents Co."	"Here is a story illustrating the Doctrine of Repair and Reconstruction:

**The Motorcycle Mechanic's Dilemma**

Meet Alex, a skilled motorcycle mechanic. He owns a 2015 Yamaha FJR1300, a high-performance sport touring bike. After a bad crash, Alex needs to repair his beloved bike, which has suffered significant damage to its frame and engine. He takes it to his local mechanic, Sam, who is well-equipped to handle the task.

Sam agrees to replace the damaged parts, including the frame, engine, and transmission, with brand-new components from a reputable manufacturer. However, when Sam tries to add a custom-made exhaust system that boosts the bike's performance, Alex's representative, a patent attorney, warns him that Yamaha, the manufacturer, may claim that Sam's modifications infringe on their patented designs.

Alex's attorney explains that, according to the Doctrine of Repair and Reconstruction, repairing damaged or defective parts is perfectly fine. This is because a reasonable owner, like Alex, must be allowed to restore their property to its original working condition. Replacing the damaged components with new ones is a legitimate exercise of the right to repair and maintain their motorcycle.

However, if Sam were to create an entirely new, custom-made exhaust system that makes the bike fundamentally a new product with a different design, function, or performance, that would be considered reconstruction, which could infringe on Yamaha's patents. That would be different. To avoid any potential disputes with Yamaha, Alex and Sam decide to settle on a standard, non- patented exhaust system that simply improves the bike's performance within the original design and functionality intended by the manufacturer."
Doctrine of res judicata	"Res judicata or res iudicata, also known as claim preclusion, is the Latin term for judged matter, and refers to either of two concepts in common law civil procedure: a case in which there has been a final judgment and that is no longer subject to appeal; and the legal doctrine meant to bar (or preclude) relitigation of a claim between the same parties.
In the case of res judicata, the matter cannot be raised again, either in the same court or in a different court. A court will use res judicata to deny reconsideration of a matter. The doctrine of res judicata is a method of preventing injustice to the parties of a case supposedly finished but perhaps also or mostly a way of avoiding unnecessary waste of judicial resources. Res judicata does not merely prevent future judgments from contradicting earlier ones, but also prevents litigants from multiplying judgments.
It is similar to the concept of double jeopardy and non bis in idem in criminal law, but the protection in criminal prosecutions only bars an identical prosecution for the same offense. However, a different offense may be charged on identical evidence at a second trial; whereas, res judicata precludes any causes of action or claims that may arise from the previously litigated subject matter."	"Sarah and Michael had a contentious divorce in 2015. They disagreed over the ownership of their jointly-owned family home and a significant amount of shared assets. After a lengthy trial, the court ultimately ruled in favor of Sarah, awarding her the majority of the assets, including the family home.

In 2020, Michael claimed that Sarah had been hiding a significant amount of hidden assets, including a secret bank account, and demanded that the court re-examine the original divorce settlement. He argued that the court had made an error and that the award should be revised.

However, the court ruled that Michael's claim was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The court determined that the matter had already been fully and finally adjudicated in the original divorce trial, and that Michael had already had his day in court. The court deemed that the earlier judgment was final and binding, and that Michael could not relitigate the same issues.

The court's decision was based not only on the fact that the original divorce trial had been fully concluded, but also on the principle that it would be unfair to allow Michael to repeatedly challenge the same issues. The doctrine of res judicata was meant to prevent precisely this kind of multiplicity of litigation, and to allow parties to finally and definitively resolve disputes once and for all.

In the end, Michael was forced to accept the original divorce settlement, and the matter was finally closed. The doctrine of res judicata had prevented unnecessary delay and expense, and allowed the parties to move on with their lives."
Doctrine of tenure	"In common law systems, land tenure, from the French verb ""tenir"" means ""to hold"", is the legal regime in which land ""owned"" by an individual is possessed by someone else who is said to ""hold"" the land, based on an agreement between both individuals. It determines who can use land, for how long and under what conditions. Tenure may be based both on official laws and policies, and on informal local customs (insofar higher law does allow that).  In other words, land tenure implies a system according to which land is held by an individual or the actual tiller of the land but this person does not have legal ownership.
It determines the holder's rights and responsibilities in connection with their holding. The sovereign monarch, known in England as the Crown, held land in its own right. All land holders are either its tenants or sub-tenants. Tenure signifies a legal relationship between tenant and lord, arranging the duties and rights of tenant and lord in relationship to the land. Over history, many different forms of land tenure, i.e., ways of holding land, have been established.
A landowner is the holder of the estate in land with the most extensive and exclusive rights of ownership over the territory, simply put, the owner of land.

"	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of ""Doctrine of Tenure"":

Emily had always dreamed of having her own bakery, but she didn't have the funds to buy the property outright. So, she approached James, a wealthy landowner, who agreed to rent her a plot of land in a prime location in exchange for a percentage of her bakery's profits. James owned the property outright, but he allowed Emily to be the one to rent and use it as long as she paid the rent (a percentage of the profits) and maintained the land as per their agreed-upon terms.

In this scenario, James is the landowner, and Emily is a tenant. While she is using the land to operate her bakery, James, as the landowner, retains the right to control the land, decide what can or cannot be done on it, and, of course, benefit from Emily's baking business. Emily has some control over how the land is used, but her relationship with the land is determined by her agreement with James, the landowner.

This arrangement illustrates the doctrine of tenure. Emily is not the true owner of the land, but she is permitted to use it while maintaining certain responsibilities and paying rent (in this case, a percentage of her profits) to the landowner. The terms of their agreement define her rights and duties as a tenant.

As the years pass, Emily becomes a successful baker, but she always knows that the land is technically owned by James, who can decide whether to renew her lease, increase her rent, or even terminate the agreement altogether."
Double aspect doctrine	"The Double aspect doctrine in Canadian constitutional law is one that allows for laws to be created by both provincial and federal governments in relation to the same subject matter. Typically, the federalist system assigns subject matters of legislation to a single head of power. However, certain matters have several dimensions to them, such that for one purpose the matter will fall to one head of power, while for another purpose, it will fall to the other. For example, highway traffic laws fall into the property and civil rights power of the province, but equally, can be a criminal offence which is in the criminal law power of the federal government.
The origin of the doctrine comes from the 1883 Privy Council decision of Hodge v. The Queen, where it was stated that ""subjects which in one aspect and for one purpose fall within s. 92, may in another aspect and for another purpose fall within s. 91""."	"Meet Emily, a lawyer who loves taking long road trips across the country. One day, she gets pulled over by a police officer on the Trans-Canada Highway. She's clocking 110 km/h in a 90 km/h zone. The officer issues her a ticket not just for speeding, but also for reckless driving.

Emily is surprised and asked the officer why she's being charged with two offenses under two different laws. The officer explains that speeding is a provincial matter, under the province's Highway Traffic Act, which concerns civil rights and property, such as the regulation of road use. On the other hand, reckless driving falls under federal jurisdiction, under the Criminal Code, which deals with crime and criminal responsibility.

This is where the Double aspect doctrine comes in. The highway can be seen from two different perspectives: as a provincial matter (concerning road use and regulation), or as a federal matter (dealing with safety and applicable standards). In this case, one aspect of driving on the highway is related to the province's civil rights and property, but another aspect, such as driving in a manner that puts others at risk, becomes a federal crime. This allows both the federal and provincial governments to have authority over different aspects of the same activity – and why Emily's traffic ticket has two charges, under two distinct laws."
Due process	"Due process of law is application by the state of all legal rules and principles pertaining to a case so all legal rights that are owed to a person are respected. Due process balances the power of law of the land and protects the individual person from it. When a government harms a person without following the exact course of the law, this constitutes a due process violation, which offends the rule of law.
Due process has also been frequently interpreted as limiting laws and legal proceedings (see substantive due process) so that judges, instead of legislators, may define and guarantee fundamental fairness, justice, and liberty. That interpretation has proven controversial. Analogous to the concepts of natural justice and procedural justice used in various other jurisdictions, the interpretation of due process is sometimes expressed as a command that the government must not be unfair to the people or abuse them physically or mentally.  The term is not used in contemporary English law, but two similar concepts are natural justice, which generally applies only to decisions of administrative agencies and some types of private bodies like trade unions, and the British constitutional concept of the rule of law as articulated by A. V. Dicey and others.: 69  However, neither concept lines up perfectly with the American theory of due process, which, as explained below, presently contains many implied rights not found in either ancient or modern concepts of due process in England.
Due process developed from clause 39 of Magna Carta in England. Reference to due process first appeared in a statutory rendition of clause 39 in 1354 thus: ""No man of what state or condition he be, shall be put out of his lands or tenements nor taken, nor disinherited, nor put to death, without he be brought to answer by due process of law."" When English and American law gradually diverged, due process was not upheld in England but became incorporated in the US Constitution."	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of due process:

Meet Sarah, a 35-year-old single mother who owns a small business in a small town. One day, the city council passes an ordinance requiring all businesses in the downtown area to display a permit on their premises. Sarah, who has been running her business for years, is not aware of this new regulation and doesn't have the permit.

On a routine inspection, the health department finds Sarah's business without a permit and shuts it down. They hand her a notice saying that her business will remain closed until she produces the permit. Sarah is devastated, as she needs her income to support her two children.

Sarah appeals the decision to the city council, but they deny her appeal, citing the need for public safety and order in the downtown area. Feeling frustrated and helpless, Sarah decides to take further action. She consults with a lawyer who specializes in civil rights and due process.

The lawyer argues that Sarah's business was unfairly shut down without following the due process of law. The lawyer points out that Sarah was not given a fair warning or an opportunity to correct the situation before her business was closed. The lawyer also argues that the city council's decision was arbitrary and without sufficient evidence.

With the lawyer's help, Sarah wins her case, and the city council is forced to reinstate her business. This time, the council provides her with a reasonable amount of time to obtain the permit and levies a small fine instead of shutting down her business.

This story illustrates the concept of due process by showing how Sarah's rights were protected by the law. She was given a fair opportunity to correct her mistake and was not arbitrarily punished by the government. The court ensured that the government followed the legal procedures, and Sarah's fundamental rights to earn a living and support her family were respected."
Duty of care	"In tort law, a duty of care is a legal obligation that is imposed on an individual, requiring adherence to a standard of reasonable care to avoid careless acts that could foreseeably harm others, and lead to claim in negligence. It is the first element that must be established to proceed with an action in negligence. The claimant must be able to show a duty of care imposed by law that the defendant has breached. In turn, breaching a duty may subject an individual to liability. The duty of care may be imposed by operation of law between individuals who have no current direct relationship (familial or contractual or otherwise) but eventually become related in some manner, as defined by common law (meaning case law).
Duty of care may be considered a formalisation of the social contract, the established and implicit responsibilities held by individuals/entities towards others within society. It is not a requirement that a duty of care be defined by law, though it will often develop through the jurisprudence of common law."	"Meet Emma, a keen hiker who loves exploring the scenic trails near her hometown. One sunny Saturday, Emma heads out to tackle a challenging trail that she's been eyeing for weeks. As she rounds a bend, she spots a group of rowdy teenagers having a picnic near the trailhead. Her attention is drawn to the careless disposal of trash and the loud noise they're making, which startles her and their dog.

Unbeknownst to Emma, the teenagers, Jack and his friends, have been warned by park rangers to clean up after themselves and keep their noise levels down. In fact, the park's rules specifically prohibit disturbing the peace or littering. Emma, however, doesn't notice the signs or the ranger's warnings.

As Emma continues her hike, she slips on a discarded soda bottle left behind by Jack's group and injures her ankle. She's forced to limp back to her car, where she receives medical attention.

In this scenario, the legal concept of duty of care comes into play. Jack and his friends owe a duty of care to others who may use the park, including Emma. They are expected to act with reasonable care to avoid careless acts that could foreseeably harm others, such as keeping their noise level down and properly disposing of trash. By breaching this duty, they have failed to uphold their social responsibilities and may be considered liable for Emma's injuries. Despite the lack of a direct relationship, Jack and Emma become ""related"" through their shared use of the public space, and the duty of care applies."
Duty to rescue	A duty to rescue is a concept in tort law and criminal law that arises in a number of cases, describing a circumstance in which a party can be held liable for failing to come to the rescue of another party who could face potential injury or death without being rescued. The exact extent of the duty varies greatly between different jurisdictions.  In common law systems, it is rarely formalized in statutes which would bring the penalty of law down upon those who fail to rescue.  This does not necessarily obviate a moral duty to rescue: though law is binding and carries government-authorized sanctions and awarded civil penalties, there are also separate ethical arguments for a duty to rescue even where law does not punish failure to rescue.	"As the storm rolled in, Sarah's elderly neighbor, Mrs. Johnson, became trapped in her flooded home. Despite her best efforts, Sarah couldn't reach Mrs. Johnson's phone to call for help. Every knock on the door went unanswered, and Sarah's anxiety grew with each passing minute.

As the waters continued to rise, Sarah knew she had to act. She grabbed a boat that was securely tied to her own houseboat and made her way through the stormy waters to Mrs. Johnson's home. Despite the treacherous conditions, Sarah managed to rescue Mrs. Johnson and brought her to safety on the shore.

The next day, Mrs. Johnson's family arrived at Sarah's doorstep, relieved to have been reunited with their loved one. However, they also brought a lawyer, who claimed that Sarah had a ""duty to rescue"" Mrs. Johnson and was now liable for any injuries or emotional trauma Mrs. Johnson may have suffered during the ordeal.

In this scenario, the concept of ""duty to rescue"" comes into play. As a neighbor, Sarah had a responsibility to come to Mrs. Johnson's aid, especially in an emergency situation where Mrs. Johnson's life was in danger. While the law doesn't explicitly state this duty, it is widely accepted that individuals have a moral obligation to assist in times of distress.

Sarah's failure to rescue Mrs. Johnson could have resulted in catastrophic consequences, and her subsequent heroic actions likely saved Mrs. Johnson from a tragic fate. The question that remains is whether Sarah's failure to intervene earlier in the crisis would have led to legal consequences, and how far her ""duty to rescue"" extends."
Duty to retreat	"In law, the duty to retreat, or requirement of safe retreat,: 550  is a legal requirement in some jurisdictions that a threatened person cannot harm another in self-defense (especially lethal force) when it is possible instead to retreat to a place of safety.: 549–554  This requirement contrasts with some other jurisdictions to stand one's ground, meaning being allowed to defend one's self instead of retreating.
It is a specific component which sometimes appears in the criminal defense of self-defense, and which must be addressed if criminal defendants are to prove that their conduct was justified. Depending on the state the criminal defendants have to prove a minimal time period of safe retreat.

"	"Sarah had always been a late-night jogger, and on this particular evening, she was running through a quiet neighborhood street when she noticed a man, clearly drunk, stumbling towards her. As he got closer, Sarah realized he was heading straight for her, his eyes glazed over and his language slurred.

Sarah, feeling a sense of unease, stopped in her tracks. The man, now mere feet away, began to mutter incoherently and reached out to grab her arm. Sarah quickly assessed her surroundings, spotting a nearby alleyway to her left and the illuminated porch light of a nearby house to her right.

In a split second, Sarah made the decision to retreat to the safer area of the porch light, thinking that the drunk man might be too disoriented to follow her. She turned and jogged quickly towards the porch, but the man, somehow manageing to stumble closer, managed to grab her elbow and hold on.

But Sarah held her ground and screamed for help, which fortunately, came in the form of a kind neighbor who rushed out of the house and tackled the drunk man to the ground. The police soon arrived, and Sarah was able to recount the events leading up to the altercation.

Thanks to her quick thinking and decision to retreat to a safe location, Sarah avoided physical harm and was able to successfully defend herself against the drunk man's attack. The lesson learned: in a situation where it's possible to retreat to a safe place, it's often the best course of action to do so, rather than resorting to physical violence."
Economic substance	"Economic substance is a doctrine in the tax law of the United States under which a transaction must have both a substantial purpose aside from reduction of tax liability and an economic effect aside from the tax effect in order to qualify for any tax benefits. This doctrine is used by the Internal Revenue Service to determine whether tax shelters, or strategies used to reduce tax liability, are considered ""abusive"". Under the doctrine, for a transaction to be respected, the transaction must change the taxpayer's economic position in a ""meaningful way"" apart from the Federal income tax effects, and the taxpayer must have had a ""substantial purpose"" for entering into the transaction, apart from the Federal income tax effects.
The economic substance doctrine was originally a common law doctrine. The doctrine was codified in subsection (o) of section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010."	"Meet Sarah, a small business owner who has a storefront on Main Street. She's been operating her business for years and pays around $50,000 in taxes annually. To reduce her tax liability, Sarah's accountant suggests that she creates a shell company, ""Artisan Ventures,"" to own the storefront. The accountant claims that because the storefront is not producing as many profits as expected, it's a ""good business decision"" to transfer the ownership to a separate entity.

However, tax experts at the IRS begin to investigate and discover that the only purpose of the shell company is to reduce Sarah's tax liability. They find that Artisan Ventures doesn't have any employees, doesn't generate any additional income, and doesn't have any tangible assets beyond the storefront. The transfer of ownership to Artisan Ventures doesn't change Sarah's economic position in any meaningful way; she's still responsible for paying rent, utilities, and other expenses, and her tax liability is significantly reduced.

The IRS deems the transfer of ownership to be a tax shelter, an ""abusive"" transaction that lacks economic substance. The IRS concludes that Sarah's substantial purpose for transferring the ownership was solely to reduce her tax liability, rather than any genuine business purpose. As a result, the IRS disallows the tax deduction and requiring Sarah to pay the full $50,000 in taxes.

This scenario illustrates the concept of economic substance. The transfer of ownership to Artisan Ventures didn't have any tangible economic effect on Sarah's business, and the primary purpose was to reduce her tax liability. The IRS looks for transactions that have a ""meaningful"" economic effect beyond the tax benefits and a ""substantial"" purpose beyond tax savings. In Sarah's case, the transaction fails to meet the economic substance doctrine, making it an abusive tax shelter."
Eggshell skull	The eggshell skull rule (also thin skull rule, papier-mâché-plaintiff rule, or talem qualem rule) is a well-established legal doctrine in common law, used in some tort law systems, with a similar doctrine applicable to criminal law.  The rule states that, in a tort case, the unexpected frailty of the injured person is not a valid defense to the seriousness of any injury caused to them.	"Meet Emma, a 25-year-old professional skydiver who has made over 500 jumps without incident. One day, while participating in a group jump, her instructor, Alex, mistakenly opens her parachute too late, causing her to crash-land and suffer severe injuries, including a broken back and permanent paralysis from the waist down.

At trial, Alex's lawyer, arguing in his defense, claims that Emma's injuries were exacerbated by her unusually fragile physical condition, due to a congenital bone disorder that made her bones unusually susceptible to injury.

However, the judge delivers a verdict that leaves Alex's lawyer stunned: since Alex's reckless actions caused the injuries, the fact that Emma's bones were more fragile than average ""was simply the straw that broke the camel's back."" In other words, the court holds that Alex's actions are still entirely responsible for the severity of Emma's injuries, regardless of her pre-existing condition.

This ruling illustrates the eggshell skull doctrine, where the unexpected frailty of the injured person does not reduce the defendant's liability. In this case, Alex's actions were still reckless and negligent, and the court holds him accountable for the full extent of Emma's injuries, including the severity caused by her fragile bones."
Emergency	"An emergency is an urgent, unexpected, and usually dangerous situation that poses an immediate risk to health, life, property, or environment and requires immediate action.  Most emergencies require urgent intervention to prevent a worsening of the situation, although in some situations, mitigation may not be possible and agencies may only be able to offer palliative care for the aftermath.
While some emergencies are self-evident (such as a natural disaster that threatens many lives), many smaller incidents require that an observer (or affected party) decide whether it qualifies as an emergency.
The precise definition of an emergency, the agencies involved and the procedures used, vary by jurisdiction, and this is usually set by the government, whose agencies (emergency services) are responsible for emergency planning and management."	"It was a typical Wednesday afternoon when Emma, a busy working mom, received a frantic call from her neighbor, Mrs. Johnson, who lived alone in the apartment above them. Mrs. Johnson was in distress, saying she had just discovered a massive pipe burst in her kitchen, flooding the entire space. Water gushed out, threatening to spread to the downstairs apartments and damage their homes.

Emma immediately sprang into action, recognizing the urgency of the situation. She quickly grabbed some towels and rushed upstairs to Mrs. Johnson's apartment. As they assessed the damage, it became clear that the situation was critical: the water was still rising, and the neighbors' apartments could be severely impacted if not addressed promptly.

Emma called 911, explaining the situation to the operator. The dispatcher promptly dispatched the emergency responders, including the fire department, who arrived within minutes. The firefighters assessed the situation and took immediate action to shut off the water main and pump out the flooded areas.

As the situation unfolded, Emma realized that this was an emergency – an unexpected, dangerous situation that required immediate action to prevent significant harm or damage to the surrounding properties. The firefighters' swift intervention prevented catastrophic consequences, minimizing the damage to Mrs. Johnson's apartment and the neighbors' homes.

This incident highlights the concept of an emergency: a sudden, unexpected, and potentially dangerous situation that requires immediate action to mitigate harm or damage. In this case, the emergency responders' prompt response saved the day, demonstrating the importance of emergency services in situations like this."
Eminent domain	"Eminent domain, also known as land acquisition, compulsory purchase, resumption, resumption/compulsory acquisition, or expropriation, is the compulsory acquisition of private property for public use. It does not include the power to take and transfer ownership of private property from one property owner to another private property owner without a valid public purpose. This power can be legislatively delegated by the state to municipalities, government subdivisions, or even to private persons or corporations, when they are authorized to exercise the functions of public character.
The most common uses of property taken by eminent domain have been for roads, government buildings and public utilities. Many railroads were given the right of eminent domain to obtain land or easements in order to build and connect rail networks. In the mid-20th century, a new application of eminent domain was pioneered, in which the government could take the property and transfer it to a private third party for redevelopment. This was initially done only to a property that had been deemed ""blighted"" or a ""development impediment"", on the principle that such properties had a negative impact upon surrounding property owners, but was later expanded to allow the taking of any private property when the new third-party owner could develop the property in such a way as to bring in increased tax revenues to the government.
Some jurisdictions require that the taker make an offer to purchase the subject property, before resorting to the use of eminent domain. However, once the property is taken and the judgment is final, the condemnor owns it in fee simple, and may put it to uses other than those specified in the eminent domain action.
Takings may be of the subject property in its entirety (total take) or in part (part take), either quantitatively or qualitatively (either partially in fee simple or, commonly, an easement, or any other interest less than the full fee simple title)."	"The small town of Willow Creek was in dire need of a new hospital. For years, the town's residents had been faced with long commutes to receive medical attention in neighboring cities. To alleviate this problem, the town council decided to exercise its right to use eminent domain to acquire a plot of land currently owned by the Smith family.

The Smiths had inherited the land from their father, who had purchased it decades ago. They had built a small farm on the property, and it had been in their family for generations. The family was devastated by the news, as they had grown attached to the land and the memories it held.

In this scenario, the town of Willow Creek is the condemnor, exercising its right of eminent domain to acquire the Smith's land for a public use, namely the construction of a new hospital. The Smiths, as the property owners, would be required to hand over their land to the town. The town would then own the land in fee simple, allowing them to use it for the intended purpose.

In this case, the taking is a total take, where the town acquires the entire property. While the Smiths might not want to part with their land, the town's need for the hospital outweighs their private interests."
Enrolled bill rule	"The enrolled bill rule is a principle of judicial interpretation of rules of procedure in legislative bodies and rule of recognition. Under the doctrine, once a bill passes a legislative body and is signed into law, the courts assume that all rules of procedure in the enactment process were properly followed. That is, ""[i]f a legislative document is authenticated in regular form by the appropriate officials, the court treats that document as properly adopted."""	"Here's a story that illustrates the enrolled bill rule:

Sarah, a devoted advocate for veterans' rights, had spent months drafting a bill to allocate additional funding for veteran rehabilitation programs. After months of deliberation, the bill finally passed the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Governor, a strong supporter of veterans, signed the bill into law.

Weeks later, a group of disgruntled lawmakers claimed that the bill should be invalidated because they had not received proper notice of the meetings preceding the vote. They argued that without proper notice, the meetings were illegal and therefore any resulting legislation was invalid.

However, when the case reached the Supreme Court, the justices applied the enrolled bill rule. They looked at the bill and found that it had been authenticated in regular form by the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, who were the appropriate officials responsible for certifying the bill.

The Court held that, as the bill had been properly authenticated, it was assumed that all rules of procedure had been followed. They didn't delve into the details of the meetings, ruling that the bill was valid and should be enforced.

Sarah breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that her tireless efforts to improve support for veterans would bear fruit. The enrolled bill rule had ensured that her bill became law, despite any procedural irregularities that might have occurred."
Enterprise liability	Enterprise liability is a legal doctrine under which individual entities (for example, otherwise legally unrelated corporations or people) can be held jointly liable for some action on the basis of being part of a shared enterprise. Enterprise liability is a form of secondary liability.	"Meet Sarah, a passionate environmental activist, who had been fighting to shut down a local factory that was contaminating the nearby river. The factory, owned by a corporation called GreenTech Inc., had been accused of releasing toxic chemicals into the water, harming local wildlife and putting the community's health at risk.

Sarah worked tirelessly to gather evidence and build a case against GreenTech Inc. She eventually partnered with other community members and formed an advocacy group called ""Clean River Now."" Together, they launched a successful campaign to raise awareness and gather support for their cause.

Meanwhile, a rival corporation, TechCorp, had also been secretly working with GreenTech Inc. on a project to develop a new, even more polluting technology. TechCorp was aware of GreenTech's illegal activities but chose to keep quiet, benefiting from the partnership and the lack of scrutiny.

As Sarah's advocacy group gained momentum, GreenTech Inc. was eventually forced to shut down the factory. However, the court held not only GreenTech Inc. but also TechCorp liable for the damage caused to the environment and the community. The court ruled that both companies were part of a shared enterprise, knowingly collaborating to harm the environment, and were therefore jointly liable for the consequences.

This scenario illustrates the concept of enterprise liability, where unrelated entities (GreenTech Inc. and TechCorp) are held accountable for their actions as part of a shared enterprise. The ruling demonstrates how secondary liability can be applied to organizations that are not directly responsible but have a connection to the harmful activities."
Equal authenticity rule	"The equal authenticity rule (French: règle d’égale autorité) is a rule of judicial interpretation developed by Canadian courts as a way of interpreting laws written in parallel French and English texts. The constitution of Canada requires that both versions of each bilingual law be treated as equally authoritative, which can result in problems when the English and French versions are incongruent. The equal authenticity rule is derived from section 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867, which states that ""The Acts of the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of Quebec shall be printed and published in both those Languages."""	"Here is a short story illustrating the equal authenticity rule:

In the small town of Saint-Étienne, Quebec, the local government passed a new bylaw requiring all residents to display a specific type of recycling bin at their homes. The bylaw was written in both French and English, as required by the Canadian Charter.

To the surprise of the town's mayor, Claude Dupont, not everyone was excited about the new rule. Many residents, including Mademoiselle Jacques, a long-time resident of Saint-Étienne, felt that the English version of the bylaw, which stated that the recycling bins must be at least 3 feet tall, was more ambiguous than the French version, which required bins to be ""maximum 30 cm de hauteur"" (around 12 inches tall).

Mademoiselle Jacques decided to challenge the bylaw in court, arguing that the English version was misleading and unfair. The judge, aware of the equal authenticity rule, carefully reviewed both versions of the bylaw. Finding that the French version was clear and specific, the judge ruled that the recycling bins in Saint-Étienne must indeed be no taller than 12 inches, rejecting Mademoiselle Jacques' argument that the English version was ambiguous.

The town's residents were relieved, and the bylaw was enforced as intended.poser. The equal authenticity rule ensured that the judge treated both versions of the bylaw with equal authority, avoiding any interpretation that might prioritize one language over the other."
Equity (law)	"In the field of jurisprudence, equity is the particular body of law, developed in the English Court of Chancery, with the general purpose of providing legal remedies for cases wherein the common law is inflexible and cannot fairly resolve the disputed legal matter. Conceptually, equity was part of the historical origins of the system of common law of England, yet is a field of law separate from common law, because equity has its own unique rules and principles, and was administered by courts of equity. 
Equity exists in domestic law, both in civil law and in common law systems, as well as in international law. The tradition of equity begins in antiquity with the writings of Aristotle (epieikeia) and with Roman law (aequitas). Later, in civil law systems, equity was integrated in the legal rules, while in common law systems it became an independent body of law."	"Emily and Ryan were childhood sweethearts who had been inseparable since high school. They had always dreamed of building a life together. After college, they decided to start a business, a small bakery, where they specialized in making unique and delicious cakes.

However, due to a series of unfortunate events, their business fell on hard times. The pandemic hit, and their bakery was forced to close for several months. When they reopened, they discovered that a large corporation had opened a similar bakery across the street, copying their famous recipes and business model.

Emily and Ryan felt devastated. They had worked hard to build their reputation and customer base, and the corporation's actions were not only unfair but also a direct threat to their livelihood. They approached their lawyer, seeking legal action against the corporation.

However, their lawyer realized that the common law didn't provide a clear remedy in this situation. The corporation hadn't technically stolen their recipes or intellectual property, but had simply copied their business model. The law was inflexible, and Emily and Ryan felt they were being unfairly disadvantaged.

In this situation, equity came into play. The court of equity considered the circumstances and applied a sense of fairness and justice to the case. The court ruled in favor of Emily and Ryan, ordering the corporation to cease their unfair business practices and awarding them compensation for the loss of business.

The story illustrates how equity, as a body of law, can provide a sense of fairness and justice in situations where the common law is inflexible or inadequate. In this scenario, the court of equity intervened to correct the unfair competition and restore the balance, ensuring that Emily and Ryan's hard work and dedication were not compromised."
Erga omnes	"In legal terminology, erga omnes rights or obligations are owed toward all. Erga omnes is a Latin phrase which means ""towards all"" or ""towards everyone"". For instance, a property right is an erga omnes entitlement and therefore enforceable against anybody infringing that right.
An erga omnes right can be distinguished from a right based on contract, which is unenforceable except against the contracting party."	"In the small town of Oakdale, the local park, Greenhaven, was a beloved gathering spot for residents and visitors alike. The town's founders had originally donated the land to be used as a public park, subject to certain conditions. Over the years, a local business owner, Maria, had built a small café and event space within the park, which had become a staple in the community.

One day, a new entrepreneur, Alex, moved to Oakdale and wanted to open a competing event space and café right across from Maria's business. Alex claimed that Maria's business was infringing on her own intellectual property rights and demanded that Maria cease operations.

However, the town's local government stepped in, citing the original deed and the town's bylaws, which stated that the park was intended for public use and enjoyment. The government reminded Alex that the right to access and use the park was an erga omnes right, owed towards all members of the community, not just one individual.

The court agreed, ruling that Maria's business was not infringing on Alex's rights, but rather was exercising its own erga omnes right to operate a business in the park. The story spread throughout Oakdale, emphasizing the importance of respecting the community's rights and interests, rather than individual rights based on contract or ownership.

This scenario illustrates how erga omnes rights can trump individual claims and legal contracts, emphasizing the community's overall benefit and well-being."
Erie doctrine	"The Erie doctrine is a fundamental legal doctrine of civil procedure in the United States which mandates that a federal court called upon to resolve a dispute not directly implicating a federal question (most commonly when sitting in diversity jurisdiction, but also when applying supplemental jurisdiction to claims factually related to a federal question or in an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy) must apply state substantive law.
The doctrine follows from the Supreme Court landmark decision in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins (1938). The case overturned Swift v. Tyson, which allowed federal judges sitting in a state to ignore the common law local decisions of state courts in the same state in diversity actions."	"Meet Emily, a small business owner in Texas who specializes in catering events. She had a contract with a local hotel to provide food and drinks for their conferences. However, one day, the hotel unexpectedly cancelled their agreement, citing a ""change in policy."" Emily's business was severely impacted, and she lost a significant amount of revenue.

Emily decided to take the hotel to court, claiming breach of contract and seeking damages. However, since both parties were from different states, the case fell under federal jurisdiction in a federal court. The federal judge reviewing the case had to decide which state's laws to apply.

As Emily's lawyer argued that Texas contract law should be applied, the hotel's lawyer countered that federal law should govern the case. The judge knew that this wasn't a federal question case, and Supreme Court's Erie doctrine came into play. The doctrine instructed the judge to apply Texas substantive law, as the trial would take place in a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction.

After applying Texas law, the judge ruled in Emily's favor, finding that the hotel had indeed breached their contract. The hotel was ordered to pay Emily $100,000 in damages. Emily was relieved to have received justice, but also grateful that the Erie doctrine ensured that state law would be applied in her case, rather than federal law."
Essential facilities doctrine	"The essential facilities doctrine (sometimes also referred to as the essential facility doctrine) is a legal doctrine which describes a particular type of claim of monopolization made under competition laws.  In general, it refers to a type of anti-competitive behavior in which a firm with market power uses a ""bottleneck"" in a market to deny competitors entry into the market.  It is closely related to a claim for refusal to deal.
The doctrine has its origins in United States law, but it has been adopted (often with some modification) into the legal systems of the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, and the European Union."	"The small town of Willow Creek was in a pickle. The only gasoline station in town, ""QuickFill,"" was owned by the wealthy and influential, the Smith family. The Smiths had dominated the market for years, and their pumps were the only ones in town that accepted credit cards.

Enter Jane, a young entrepreneur with a dream to open her own convenience store. She spent months saving up and finally secured a loan to open her new store, ""Jane's Grocery."" But when she went to apply for a business loan, she was denied because she couldn't provide a guarantee that she could pump gasoline for her customers.

That's when she discovered the catch - QuickFill had a monopoly on the only credit card-ready pumps in town. The Smiths had ""bottlenecked"" the market, controlling the flow of gasoline and charging exorbitant fees for each pump. As a result, Jane's Grocery was unable to compete.

Jane decided to fight back and filed a lawsuit against the Smiths, citing the essential facilities doctrine. She argued that the Smiths were using their control over the pumps to stifle competition and prevent her from entering the market. The court agreed, and an injunction was issued, forcing the Smiths to open their pumps to other businesses, including Jane's Grocery.

With her pumps now available, Jane was able to offer competitive gas prices and attract customers from all over town. The Smiths were no longer the only game in town, and the once-strangled market began to thrive."
Estoppel	"Estoppel is a judicial device whereby a court may prevent or ""estop"" a person from making assertions or from going back on their word. The person barred from doing so is said to be ""estopped"". Estoppel may prevent someone from bringing a particular claim. In common law legal systems, the legal doctrine of estoppel is based in both common law and equity. 
Estoppel is also a concept in international law.

"	"Meet Emma, a freelance writer, who had been working with a publishing company, Blue Ocean Books, for three years. She had built a strong reputation with the company and had become a go-to author for their readers. In 2020, Emma and Blue Ocean Books had a conversation about her next book project. Emma mentioned that she was open to a one-book deal, and Blue Ocean Books agreed to offer her a two-book deal, citing her popularity and the company's success with her previous works.

The contract was never signed, but Emma and Blue Ocean Books worked together on the new book project, knowing that the details would be finalized later. Fast-forward to 2022, when Emma received another offer from Green Ocean Publishing, a rival company. Emma decided to sign with Green Ocean and published her new book with them. When Blue Ocean Books found out, they claimed that Emma was bound by their original agreement and that she was breaching their contract.

However, the court ruled that Emma was not liable to fulfill the two-book deal with Blue Ocean Books. This is because Blue Ocean Books never followed through on their promise to sign the contract, and Emma reasonably acted on the understanding that the deal was off. The court used the doctrine of estoppel to prevent Blue Ocean Books from going back on their word. They were estopped from claiming that Emma was bound by the original agreement. This allowed Emma to pursue her new publishing deal with Green Ocean Publishing without any legal repercussions."
Evasion (law)	"Evasion in law, is a fundamental public policy doctrine, which exists also in the conflict of laws.

"	"Meet Emma, a travel enthusiast who loves exploring new places. She books a ticket to France for a three-week trip, excited to immerse herself in the culture and language. As she packs her bags, she rummages through her finances and realizes she might not have enough funds to cover the entire trip. Undeterred, Emma applies for a cash advance on her credit card, knowing it will put her into the red. She reassures herself she'll pay it off as soon as she returns from France.

Upon arriving in France, Emma decides to spend a few extra days, enjoying the scenic countryside and wineries. She accumulates a significant expense, and her initial plan to pay off the credit card advance in one shot seems unfeasible. Emma starts making multiple, small cash withdrawals from her credit card, claiming she's just covering small expenses, like buying souvenirs or meals. In reality, she's using the card for larger, discretionary purchases, such as a luxury hotel stay or a spa treatment.

Emma's evasion becomes apparent when the credit card company files a request with the French courts, seeking to recover the outstanding balance. Emma's excuses and justifications fall flat, as the court finds her intentional circumvention of the credit card's terms and intended use. The court rules in favor of the credit card company, ordering Emma to pay the entire balance, plus interest and penalties. Emma's attempt to evade responsibility for her overspending has failed, and she's left dealing with the financial consequences of her actions.

This story illustrates the legal concept of evasion, where an individual intentionally manipulates or omits information to avoid legal obligations or liabilities. Emma's actions were calculated efforts to sidestep her financial responsibilities, ultimately leading to her downfall."
Everything which is not forbidden is allowed	"""Everything which is not forbidden is allowed"" is a legal maxim. It is the concept that any action can be taken unless there is a law against it. It is also known in some situations as the ""general power of competence"" whereby the body or person being regulated is acknowledged to have competent judgement of their scope of action.
The opposite principle ""everything which is not allowed is forbidden"" states that an action can only be taken if it is specifically allowed.
A senior English judge, Sir John Laws, stated the principles as: ""For the individual citizen, everything which is not forbidden is allowed; but for public bodies, and notably government, everything which is not allowed is forbidden."" Legal philosopher Ota Weinberger put it this way: ""In a closed system in which all obligations are stated explicitly the following inference rules are valid: (XI) Everything which is not forbidden is allowed""."	"Meet Emma, a passionate artist living in a bustling city. She loves to express herself through street art, painting vibrant murals on abandoned walls. However, one day, she receives a notice from the city council claiming that her art is causing a disturbance to the community and is threatening to fine her if she doesn't stop.

Emma is confused. She had always thought that as long as she wasn't breaking any specific laws, she was free to create. But the council seems to be saying that just because she isn't explicitly allowed to do so, her art is therefore forbidden.

A lawyer friend explains the concept of ""everything which is not forbidden is allowed"" to Emma. She realizes that the council doesn't have a specific law prohibiting street art, so they can't legally stop her from doing it. The lawyer advises Emma to continue creating, but to be mindful of any noise or obstruction complaints from local residents.

Emma decides to take the opportunity to engage with her community, talking to nearby business owners and residents about her art and explaining its benefits to the neighborhood. She also works with the council to develop a policy that allows street art in designated areas, while still respecting the community's concerns.

Through this experience, Emma has learned that as a citizen, everything which is not forbidden is indeed allowed. As long as she isn't causing harm or breaking any laws, she is free to express herself through her art."
Ex turpi causa non oritur actio	"Ex turpi causa non oritur actio (Latin ""action does not arise from a dishonourable cause"") is a legal doctrine which states that a plaintiff will be unable to pursue legal relief and damages if it arises in connection with their own tortious act. The corresponding Ex turpe causa non oritur damnum, ""From a dishonourable cause, no damage arises"" is a similar construction.  Particularly relevant in the law of contract, tort and trusts, ex turpi causa is also known as the illegality defence, since a defendant may plead that even though, for instance, he broke a contract, conducted himself negligently or broke an equitable duty, nevertheless a claimant by reason of his own illegality cannot sue. The UK Supreme Court provided a thorough reconsideration of the doctrine in 2016 in Patel v Mirza."	"The sun was setting over the streets of London as Alex, a young and ambitious entrepreneur, was about to close a deal with his long-time business partner, Ryan. They had been working tirelessly for months to finalise the agreement, and Alex was confident that it would secure a major contract for their company.

However, just as the documents were about to be signed, Alex suddenly revealed that he had been secretly working on a side project in competition with Ryan and their partnership. Ryan was devastated and felt betrayed by Alex's actions.

The agreement was scrapped, and Ryan was left feeling unable to pursue a legal remedy. As his lawyer explained, it was because Alex's own unethical actions, or ""tortious act"", had led to the breakdown of the partnership. According to the doctrine of ex turpi causa non oritur actio, a plaintiff cannot seek legal relief or damages if they have contributed to the situation themselves through their own unacceptable behavior.

Ryan realized that he had no legal recourse, and the stress and anxiety of the situation took a toll on him. Meanwhile, Alex's actions had not only damaged their partnership but also his own reputation, as the news of his deceit spread quickly throughout the business community.

This story illustrates how the doctrine of ex turpi causa non oritur actio can be used to prevent individuals from profiting from their own wrongdoings. In this case, Alex's unfair actions led to the downfall of the partnership, and he was unable to seek legal redress for the consequences that followed."
Exceptional circumstances	Exceptional circumstances are the conditions required to grant additional powers to a government agency or government leader so as to alleviate, or mitigate, unforeseen or unconventional hardship. The term is commonly used in Australia, where it has been applied in various contexts, most recognizably in relation to special consideration policies for students and drought relief payments for farmers known as Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payments or ECRP.	"As the rural town of Willow Creek struggled to recover from a severe protracted drought, local farmer John Taylor found himself in a desperate situation. His livestock were dying, his crops were failing, and he was struggling to make ends meet. The Australian government's normal financial support was not enough to sustain him, so he turned to the Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payment (ECRP) program, a special package designed to help farmers like him in extreme situations.

The government agency responsible for disbursing the funds, the Department of Agriculture, required John to demonstrate that he was experiencing ""exceptional circumstances"" that were beyond his control and had a significant impact on his livelihood. With the help of his accountant, John gathered evidence of the devastating drought, including records of crop failures, livestock losses, and reduced income.

The government agency reviewed John's application and deemed his circumstances to be indeed exceptional. As a result, they granted him additional financial assistance, exceeding the normal support package. The extra funds allowed John to maintain his farm, pay his debts, and even invest in future agricultural ventures.

Through this story, we see how exceptional circumstances can apply to individuals, in this case, a farmer, in times of unforeseen hardship. The government agency's response acknowledges the unusual severity of the drought and provides additional support to alleviate John's crisis. The concept of exceptional circumstances allows for flexibility in providing relief, recognizing that individual situations may be more severe or complex than normal protocols can accommodate."
Exclusionary rule	"In the United States, the exclusionary rule is a legal rule, based on constitutional law, that prevents evidence collected or analyzed in violation of the defendant's constitutional rights from being used in a court of law. This may be considered an example of a prophylactic rule formulated by the judiciary in order to protect a constitutional right. The exclusionary rule may also, in some circumstances at least, be considered to follow directly from the constitutional language, such as the Fifth Amendment's command that no person ""shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself"" and that no person ""shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law"".
The exclusionary rule is grounded in the Fourth Amendment in the Bill of Rights, and it is intended to protect citizens from illegal searches and seizures. The exclusionary rule is also designed to provide a remedy and disincentive for criminal prosecution from prosecutors and police who illegally gather evidence in violation of the Fifth Amendment and its protection against self-incrimination. The exclusionary rule also protects against violations of the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees the right to counsel.
Most states also have their own exclusionary remedies for illegally obtained evidence under their state constitutions or statutes, some of which predate the federal constitutional guarantees against unlawful searches and seizures and compelled self-incrimination.
This rule is occasionally referred to as a legal technicality because it allows defendants a defense that does not address whether the crime was actually committed. In this respect, it is similar to the explicit rule in the Fifth Amendment protecting people from double jeopardy. In strict cases, when an illegal action is used by the police or the prosecution to gain any incriminating result, all evidence whose recovery stemmed from the illegal action—this evidence is known as ""fruit of the poisonous tree""—can be thrown out from a jury (or be grounds for a mistrial if too much information has been irrevocably revealed).
The exclusionary rule applies to all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States regardless of whether they are citizens, immigrants (legal or illegal), or visitors."	"Sarah, a law student, was driving home from a late-night shift at the library when her car was stopped by a police officer for a routine traffic violation. As the officer approached her window, he noticed that the car's taillight was slightly cracked. He asked Sarah to step out of the car and, without telling her why, patted her down and searched the car. The officer then found a small bag of marijuana on the passenger seat and arrested Sarah for possession.

At her trial, the prosecution presented the bag of marijuana as evidence. But Sarah's lawyer argued that the search was unconstitutional because the officer didn't have probable cause to stop her and search the car. Furthermore, the officer didn't read Sarah her Miranda rights before questioning her.

The judge agreed with Sarah's lawyer and suppressed the evidence, ruling that the search was illegal and therefore the bag of marijuana could not be used in court. Despite the fact that the police clearly found the marijuana, it couldn't be used as evidence because it was obtained in violation of Sarah's Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures.

Sarah's lawyer argued that even the knowledge of the marijuana's presence was ""fruit of the poisonous tree"" and couldn't be used as evidence. The judge ultimately dismissed the charges, citing the exclusionary rule and the importance of protecting citizens from illegal searches and seizures. Sarah was acquitted and walked out of the courtroom a free woman, thanks to the rule that excludes evidence obtained in violation of her constitutional rights."
Executive privilege	"Executive privilege is the right of the president of the United States and other members of the executive branch to maintain confidential communications under certain circumstances within the executive branch and to resist some subpoenas and other oversight by the legislative and judicial branches of government in pursuit of particular information or personnel relating to those confidential communications. The right comes into effect when revealing the information would impair governmental functions. Neither executive privilege nor the oversight power of Congress is explicitly mentioned in the United States Constitution.  However, the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that executive privilege and congressional oversight each are a consequence of the doctrine of the separation of powers, derived from the supremacy of each branch in its area of constitutional activity.
The Supreme Court confirmed the legitimacy of this doctrine in United States v. Nixon in the context of a subpoena emanating from the judiciary instead of emanating from Congress. The Court held that there is a qualified privilege, which once invoked, creates a presumption of privilege, and the party seeking the documents must then make a ""sufficient showing"" that the ""presidential material"" is ""essential to the justice of the case"". Chief Justice Warren Burger further stated that executive privilege would most effectively apply when the oversight of the executive would impair that branch's national security concerns.  Regarding requests from Congress (instead of from the courts) for executive branch information, as of a 2014 study by the Congressional Research Service, only two federal court cases had addressed the merits of executive privilege in such a context, and neither of those cases reached the Supreme Court.
In addition to which branch of government is requesting the information, another characteristic of executive privilege is whether it involves a ""presidential communications privilege"" or instead a ""deliberative process privilege"" or some other type of privilege. The deliberative process privilege is often considered to be rooted in common law. In contrast, the presidential communications privilege is often considered rooted in the separation of powers, thus making the deliberative process privilege less difficult to overcome. Generally speaking, presidents, congresses and courts have historically tended to sidestep open confrontations through compromise and mutual deference because of previous practice and precedents regarding the exercise of executive privilege.

"	"It was a typical Monday morning at the White House when President Rachel Jenkins received an unexpected phone call from her Secretary of Defense, James Miller. Miller informed the President that a Congressional Committee was demanding the administration's internal notes and emails regarding a recent arms deal with a foreign country.

Rachel was taken aback. She understood that Congressional oversight was necessary, but she was concerned that releasing those documents would impact national security. The deal was still in its infancy, and revealing the details could jeopardize future negotiations and compromise the country's interests.

After consulting with her advisors, Rachel invoked executive privilege, citing that the documents were confidential communications under the deliberative process privilege. She maintained that revealing the information would impair the executive branch's ability to conduct foreign policy negotiations and could potentially harm national security.

The Congressional Committee, led by Chairwoman Emily Patel, responded by arguing that the privilege was an abuse of power and that the Committee had a legitimate need for the information to ensure transparency and accountability.

As the standoff continued, Rachel made a public statement, emphasizing the importance of protecting confidential communications to ensure the effective functioning of the executive branch. Chairwoman Patel countered, stating that the Committee's investigation was essential to maintaining the public's trust in government.

The dispute eventually led to a series of closed-door meetings and private negotiations between the President and the Chairwoman. After several weeks, they reached a compromise: the administration would provide limited information, while the Committee would agree to hold off on further inquiry until the deal was finalized.

Rachel's decision to invoke executive privilege had prevented the premature revelation of confidential information, preserving the nation's security interests while still accommodating the Committee's legitimate oversight needs. It was a delicate balancing act, but one that highlighted the importance of maintaining confidentiality in sensitive government communications."
Exhausted combination doctrine	"The exhausted combination doctrine, also referred to as the doctrine of the Lincoln Engineering case, was the doctrine of U.S. patent law that when an inventor invents a new, unobvious device and seeks to patent not merely the new device but also the combination of the new device with a known, conventional device with which the new device cooperates in the conventional and predictable way in which devices of those types have previously cooperated, the combination is unpatentable as an ""exhausted combination"" or ""old combination"".  The doctrine is also termed the doctrine of the Lincoln Engineering case because the United States Supreme Court explained the doctrine in its decision in Lincoln Engineering Co. v. Stewart-Warner Corp. This doctrine has been considered abrogated by the US Congress in 1952, when it passed the 1952 Patent Act."	"Meet Emma, a talented inventor who runs her own kitchen gadget company. She's developed a revolutionary new blender that can puree hot ingredients like soup and sauces more efficiently than any other blender on the market. Emma is eager to patent her invention and proudly presents it to the patent office.

To her surprise, the patent office denies her application, citing the exhausted combination doctrine. Emma is puzzled - didn't she just invent something entirely new and innovative? The patent examiner explains that while Emma's blender is an improvement over existing blenders, it's not the only new component at play. The examiner points out that Emma's blender is designed to work seamlessly with conventional kitchen countertops and sinks.

The examiner notes that blenders have been integrated into kitchen countertops and sinks for decades, and it's obvious to anyone in the industry that these components would naturally work together in this way. The combination of Emma's new blender with common kitchen fixtures is therefore an ""exhausted combination"" or ""old combination"" - not worthy of a patent.

Emma realizes that the patent office is correct. She didn't invent a fundamental change in the way kitchen blenders interact with countertops and sinks. She simply improved upon an existing technology. Understanding the exhausted combination doctrine, Emma decides to focus on patenting her unique blender design, rather than the expected way it would work with common kitchen fixtures. With this revised approach, Emma is able to secure a patent and continue innovating in the kitchen gadget industry."
Exhaustion doctrine under U.S. law	"See also Exhaustion of intellectual property rights for a general introduction not limited to U.S. law.
The exhaustion doctrine, also referred to as the first sale doctrine, is a U.S. common law patent doctrine that limits the extent to which patent holders can control an individual article of a patented product after a so-called authorized sale. Under the doctrine, once an authorized sale of a patented article occurs, the patent holder's exclusive rights to control the use and sale of that article are said to be ""exhausted,"" and the purchaser is free to use or resell that article without further restraint from patent law. However, under the repair and reconstruction doctrine, the patent owner retains the right to exclude purchasers of the articles from making the patented invention anew (i.e., making another article), unless it is specifically authorized by the patentee to do so.
Procedurally, the patent exhaustion doctrine operates as an affirmative defense, shielding authorized purchasers from infringement claims concerning the sale or use (including repair and modification) of a patented product after the patent owner authorized its sale.
Because only an ""authorized"" sale triggers the doctrine, it may be difficult or at least controversial to determine whether the exhaustion doctrine applies in a particular case: for example, when the patentee purports to restrict or condition the use or resale of the patented article once purchased and in the hands of an end user (post-sale restrictions); or when the patentee licenses another to manufacture and use or sell the patented product only in a particular field. The 2008 Supreme Court decision in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., arguably leaves unclear the extent to which patentees can avoid the exhaustion doctrine by means of so-called limited licenses (licenses limited to a specified field of use). Since its development by the courts in the late 19th century, the patent exhaustion doctrine has raised questions regarding the scope of exclusive rights granted by patents and the extent to which a patent owner may extend those rights to control downstream use and sales of patented articles."	"Meet Sarah, a devoted fan of sneakers. She's been waiting for months for the release of the latest limited edition style from her favorite brand, ""KickTech."" Finally, she receives a notification that they're in stock. She purchases a pair online directly from KickTech, along with a few other items, to get free shipping.

As Sarah starts wearing her new kicks, she notices a small tear on the side and decides to get it repaired by a local cobbler. The cobbler, Alex, charges her a reasonable fee and does a great job. Sarah is thrilled with the repair and continues to wear her beloved shoes.

However, KickTech's CEO, James, decides to become aggressive about maintaining control over their patented design. He sends a letter to Alex, claiming that repairing the shoe is an infringement of their patent and demanding that Alex stop doing business with Sarah and any other customers. James also threatens to sue Sarah directly for reselling the shoe.

But here's the thing: KickTech authorized the original sale to Sarah. Since then, Sarah is free to use or resell the shoe as she pleases, without KickTech's further approval. The exhaustion doctrine kicks in, protecting Sarah and Alex from legal action. KickTech can't restrict Sarah's use of the shoe or control how Alex repairs it. While KickTech still owns the underlying patent, the doctrine removes any patent-based restrictions on the shoe once it's been authorized for sale.

This story illustrates how the exhaustion doctrine helps prevent patent holders from exerting unfair control over the use and resale of patented products once they've been authorized for sale."
Exhaustion of intellectual property rights	"The exhaustion of intellectual property rights constitutes one of the limits of intellectual property (IP) rights. Once a given product has been sold under the authorization of the IP owner, the reselling, rental, lending and other third party commercial uses of IP-protected goods in domestic and international markets are governed by the principle.
After a product covered by an IP right, such as by a patent right, has been sold by the IP right owner or by others with the consent of the owner, the IP right is said to be exhausted. It can no longer be exercised by the owner. This limitation is also referred to as the exhaustion doctrine or first sale doctrine. For example, if an inventor obtains a patent on a new kind of umbrella, the inventor (or anyone else to whom he sells his patent) can legally prohibit other companies from making and selling this kind of umbrella, but cannot prohibit customers who have bought this umbrella from the patent owner from reselling the umbrella to third parties. Or if a piece of software containing a patented algorithm is distributed by the patent owner, then the patent is exhausted.
While there is a ""fairly broad consensus"" throughout the world that patent exhaustion ""applies at least within the context of the domestic market"", ""[t]here is less consensus as to what extent the sale of an IP protected product abroad can exhaust the IP rights over this product in the context of domestic law."" The former is the concept of ""national exhaustion"", the latter of ""regional exhaustion"" or ""international exhaustion"". The rules and legal implications of the exhaustion largely differ depending on the country of importation, i.e. the national jurisdiction.
The legal concept of international exhaustion is much more controversial, and is recognized in some countries but not in others. The importation, in a country that recognizes the concept of international exhaustion, of a product sold in a foreign country with the authorization of the IP right owner cannot be prevented by the IP right owner. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), an international agreement administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO), does not address the issue of exhaustion of intellectual property rights.
Brexit in 2020 caused restrictions on trade out of the UK, creating an asymmetric exhaustion status enabling imports to the UK from the EEA where there is no matching opportunity for parallel exports from the UK to the EEA. This was thought in February 2022 to be likely to continue for some time, or even indefinitely."	"Meet Emma, a young entrepreneur who has developed a revolutionary new type of innovative smartphone case. She patents her design and begins manufacturing and selling her cases in the UK. The demand is high, and she soon realizes she can't keep up with orders on her own.

Emma decides to partner with a global company, TechCorp, which has a large distribution network and manufacturing capabilities. She licenses her patent to TechCorp, allowing them to mass-produce and sell her cases across the globe.

One day, a customer named Sarah buys an Emma's cases from a TechCorp authorized retailer in the UK. Sarah is thrilled with her new case and uses it for months. But then, she decides to sell her used case to a friend, Alex, who lives in the United States.

The question arises: Can Emma, the patent holder, stop Sarah from reselling her used case to Alex in the US? And more importantly, can Emma prohibit Alex from using the case in the US?

In the UK, where Emma originally patented her design, the answer is no. Emma's patent is exhausted, which means she can't stop Sarah from reselling the used case to Alex. The same principle applies in the UK's domestic market.

However, if Emma wanted to stop the case from being resold in the US, she would face a different legal landscape. The US has its own laws and regulations regarding intellectual property, and it's unclear whether Emma's patent would be considered ""exhausted"" internationally. This concept of international exhaustion is still a topic of debate among legal experts and jurists.

In the end, Sarah sells her used case to Alex, and Alex uses it without any issues from Emma, the patent holder. Emma's case has exhausted its intellectual property rights in the UK, allowing the used case to be resold and used in the US without any legal restrictions."
Exhaustion of remedies	"The doctrine of exhaustion of remedies prevents a litigant from seeking a remedy in a new court or jurisdiction until all claims or remedies have been exhausted (pursued as fully as possible) in the original one. The doctrine was originally created by case law based on the principles of comity.
In the United States, exhaustion of remedies is applied extensively in administrative law. Many cases are handled first by independent agencies of the United States government which have primary responsibility for cases involving the statutes or regulations which the agency administers. 
A person's specific rights and duties depend on the federal statute involved, but here is an outline of how the doctrine works in practice.  ""Exhaustion of administrative remedies"" requires a person to first go to the agency which administers the statute; this process usually involves filing a petition, then going to a hearing, and finally using the agency's internal appeal process.  Once the agency's own procedures are finished, or ""exhausted"", then the aggrieved person can file a complaint in a federal court.  But the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies prevents parties from seeking relief in the courts first.
The same process is required under the laws of many, if not all, states.
Exhaustion of remedies frequently affects cases of habeas corpus. Federal law, for example, prevents a petitioner from seeking federal relief where the state claims have not yet been exhausted.[1] Generally, the exhaustion requirement permits state courts a ""...meaningful opportunity to consider the allegations of legal error.""[2]"	"Emily, a初aterisk homeowner, was incensed when she received a notice from her local water district stating that they would be raising her monthly water bill by 50%. Convinced that the increase was unjust, she requested a hearing to protest the rate hike. The water district held a hearing, but their decision on her appeal was unsatisfactory, upholding the rate increase.

Undeterred, Emily filed a complaint with her local courts seeking an injunction to halt the rate hike. Her attorney argued that the rate increase was unfair and would cause her financial hardship. However, the judge explained that Emily had not followed the proper procedures first by requesting a rehearing within the water district. ""We can't consider your case yet,"" the judge said, ""since you haven't exhausted your remedies through the water district's internal appeal process.""

According to state law, all water district actions regarding rate-making had to undergo the agency's reviews and appeals. Emily had to rely on the water district's process and appeal decisions before approaching the courts. ""This is how it works for most agencies,"" the judge explained, ""First you go through the agency's system, then your designated court system.""

Emily realized she had made a mistake by jumping straight to the courts. She had no option but to retrace her steps, appeal to the water district's governing board again, and exhaust their process before she can return to the courts with her case."
Fair use	"Fair use is a doctrine in United States law that permits limited use of copyrighted material without having to first acquire permission  from the copyright holder. Fair use is one of the limitations to copyright intended to balance the interests of copyright holders with the public interest in the wider distribution and use of creative works by allowing as a defense to copyright infringement claims certain limited uses that might otherwise be considered infringement. The U.S. ""fair use doctrine"" is generally broader than the ""fair dealing"" rights known in most countries that inherited English Common Law. The fair use right is a general exception that applies to all different kinds of uses with all types of works. In the U.S., fair use right/exception is based on a flexible proportionality test that examines the purpose of the use, the amount used, and the impact on the market of the original work.
The doctrine of ""fair use"" originated in common law during the 18th and 19th centuries as a way of preventing copyright law from being too rigidly applied and ""stifling the very creativity which [copyright] law is designed to foster."" Though originally a common law doctrine, it was enshrined in statutory law when the U.S. Congress passed the Copyright Act of 1976. The U.S. Supreme Court has issued several major decisions clarifying and reaffirming the fair use doctrine since the 1980s, the most recent being in the 2021 decision Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc.

"	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of fair use:

Nina, a small business owner, had just launched her new bakery in a cozy neighborhood in Brooklyn. She was thrilled to share her passion for baking with the community, but she knew that creating a brand identity was crucial to stand out from the competition. She stumbled upon a beautiful image of a layered croquembouche on a food blogger's Instagram account, which she felt perfectly captured the whimsical, French-inspired atmosphere she wanted to evoke.

Intrigued, Nina asked permission to use the image on her bakery's social media accounts and website, but the food blogger, Sarah, had already removed the image and claimed it was copyrighted. Undeterred, Nina decided to recreate the image herself, using her own camera and styling to create a similar, yet distinct, visual depiction of her own croquembouche.

When Sarah contacted Nina, accused her of copyright infringement, and demanded she take down the image, Nina asserted fair use. She argued that she had transformed the original image by creating an original work, and that the use was for a transformative purpose (a small business promotion) rather than commercial exploitation of Sarah's work. Nina had used only a small portion of the original image and had not impacted the commercial value of Sarah's work. After a brief conversation, Sarah agreed that Nina's use was indeed a fair use and they parted ways amicably.

This story illustrates how the fair use doctrine allows for limited use of copyrighted material without permission, as long as the use is transformative, minimal, and doesn't harm the original creator's market. Nina's creative adaptation of Sarah's image, while inspired by the original, was a distinct and original work, allowing her to avoid copyright infringement claims."
Faithless servant	"The faithless servant doctrine pursuant to which employees who act unfaithfully towards their employers must forfeit to their employers all compensation received during the period of disloyalty.
It is under the laws of a number of states in the United States, and most notably New York State law."	"Meet Emily, a talented and ambitious marketing executive at a New York-based startup, TechCorp. Emily is well-compensated, with a six-figure salary and bonuses, and is considered a key member of the team. However, as the company's financial struggles intensify, Emily becomes increasingly disillusioned with the management's vision and starts to seek better opportunities.

Unbeknownst to TechCorp, Emily begins secretly working on a competing project, using company resources and confidential information to further her own interests. Meanwhile, she continues to collect her paycheck and reap the benefits of her employment, including a lucrative bonus package.

When TechCorp discovers Emily's betrayal, they immediately terminate her employment and initiate legal action. Under New York State law, TechCorp argues that Emily has acted as a ""faithless servant,"" demonstrating disloyalty and dishonesty towards their employer. As a result, they claim that Emily must forfeit all compensation received during the period of her disloyalty, including her salary, bonuses, and any other benefits.

In court, Emily's lawyers argue that she was simply seeking better opportunities and that her actions did not constitute a breach of fiduciary duty. However, the judge rules in TechCorp's favor, holding that Emily's actions were indeed faithless and that she must surrender all compensation received during the period of her disloyalty. Emily is left with nothing, a harsh reminder of the consequences of failing to uphold the trust and loyalty expected of an employee."
FCC fairness doctrine	"The fairness doctrine of the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC), introduced in 1949, was a policy that required the holders of broadcast licenses both to present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that fairly reflected differing viewpoints. In 1987, the FCC abolished the fairness doctrine, prompting some to urge its reintroduction through either Commission policy or congressional legislation. The FCC removed the rule that implemented the policy from the Federal Register in August 2011.
The fairness doctrine had two basic elements: It required broadcasters to devote some of their airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. Stations were given wide latitude as to how to provide contrasting views: It could be done through news segments, public affairs shows, or editorials. The doctrine did not require equal time for opposing views but required that contrasting viewpoints be presented. The demise of this FCC rule has been cited as a contributing factor in the rising level of party polarization in the United States.
While the original purpose of the doctrine was to ensure that viewers were exposed to a diversity of viewpoints, it was used by both the Kennedy and later the Johnson administration to combat political opponents operating on talk radio. In 1969 the United States Supreme Court, in Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, upheld the FCC's general right to enforce the fairness doctrine where channels were limited. However, the court did not rule that the FCC was obliged to do so. The courts reasoned that the scarcity of the broadcast spectrum, which limited the opportunity for access to the airwaves, created a need for the doctrine.
The fairness doctrine is not the same as the equal-time rule, which is still in place. The fairness doctrine deals with discussion of controversial issues, while the equal-time rule deals only with political candidates."	"It was a hot summer evening in August 2023, and Temperance Valley, a small town in the heartland of America, was buzzing with excitement. The upcoming mayoral election was just around the corner, and the local television station, TVV, was hosting a live debate between the two contenders, Sarah Johnson and Tom Harris.

As the debate moderator, journalist Lucy White, introduced the panelists, she highlighted the town's pressing issues, including the development of a new solar farm and the mayor's handling of the recent flooding incident. The debate was lively, with both candidates presenting their views and counterarguments.

However, some viewers felt that the debate did not accurately represent the diverse opinions within the community. John Williams, a local business owner, strongly disagreed with Sarah's stance on the solar farm, citing environmental concerns. On the other hand, Maria Rodriguez, a concerned citizen, felt that Tom's response to the flooding was inadequate.

As the debate concluded, Lucy revealed that TVV would air a follow-up segment the following night, featuring a panel of local experts and community representatives discussing the solar farm and flooding issues. The segment would present a range of perspectives, including a representative from the environmental group, ""Green Valley,"" and a local flood victim. By providing this additional airtime, TVV was fulfilling its obligation to the fairness doctrine, ensuring that the community was exposed to a diversity of viewpoints on the critical issues affecting their town.

In this relatable scenario, TVV demonstrated its commitment to discussing controversial topics and presenting contrasting views, thereby adhering to the principles of the fairness doctrine."
Finality (law)	"Finality, in law, is the concept that certain disputes must achieve a resolution from which no further appeal may be taken and from which no collateral proceedings may be permitted to disturb that resolution. For example, in some jurisdictions, such as the state of New York, those convicted of a crime may not sue their defence attorney for incompetence or legal malpractice if the civil lawsuit would call into question the finality of the criminal conviction.
Finality is crucial because otherwise, there would be no certainty as to the meaning of the law or the outcome of any legal process. The principle is an aspect of the separation of powers, a distinction between the executive and the judicial power. That concept was defined in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) in which a court stated that unless orders were valid until set aside, ""the exercise of judicial power could yield no adjudication of right and liability to which immediate effect could be given"".
The importance of finality is the source of the concept of res judicata: the decisions of one court are settled law and may not be retried in another case brought in a different court."	"Samantha had always maintained her innocence when she was arrested and charged with embezzlement from her former employer. After a lengthy trial, the judge delivered a guilty verdict, sentencing her to five years in prison. Despite her protests of innocence, the verdict was final, and she was shipped off to join the general population at the local penitentiary.

Months later, Samantha wrote a scathing letter to her former lawyer, claiming he had been incompetent and negligent in presenting her defense. She believed that if he had done his job properly, she would have been acquitted. She demanded a refund and threatened to sue him for damages.

Her lawyer replied, pointing out that the conviction had been final for months, and the law wouldn't permit a civil lawsuit that would undermine the criminal judgment. He explained that if Samantha were to succeed in her lawsuit, it would essentially overturn the conviction, creating chaos and uncertainty in the criminal justice system.

Samantha was devastated. She realized that the law protected the integrity of the criminal justice process, ensuring that once a verdict was rendered, it was final and couldn't be challenged in a subsequent civil lawsuit. She was stuck with her conviction, but she could also move on, knowing that the system had given her a fair trial.

In the end, Samantha decided to focus on her rehabilitation and personal growth, rather than pursuing a costly and futile lawsuit. Her story serves as a reminder of the importance of finality in the law, ensuring that justice is served and the legal process is respected."
Firm offer	"A firm offer is an offer that will remain open for a certain period or until a certain time or occurrence of a certain event, during which it is incapable of being revoked. As a general rule, all offers are revocable at any time prior to acceptance, even those offers that purport to be irrevocable on their face.
In the United States, an exception is the merchant firm offer rule set out in Uniform Commercial Code - § 2-205, which states that an offer is firm and irrevocable if it is an offer to buy or sell goods made by a merchant and it is in writing and signed by the offeror. Such an offer is irrevocable even in the absence of consideration. If no time is stated, it is irrevocable for a reasonable time, but in no event may a period of irrevocability exceed three months. Any such term of assurance in a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.
However, even when the period of irrevocability expires, the offer may still remain open until revoked or rejected according to the general rules regarding termination of an offer.
If the offeree rejects, fails to accept the terms of the offer, fixed or otherwise, or makes a counter-offer, then the original offer is terminated."	"Tom, a small business owner, was looking to sell his old truck business to a potential buyer, Alex. After months of negotiations, Tom finally made a firm offer to sell the business for $50,000. The offer was in writing, signed by Tom, and stated that it would remain open for 6 weeks. Tom told Alex that this was a ""take it or leave it"" deal and that he would not be able to retract the offer during that time.

Alex was thrilled with the offer and took 3 weeks to deliberate. Towards the end of the 6-week period, Alex asked Tom if he would be willing to meet him halfway on the price. Tom was hesitant but agreed to meet Alex halfway, bringing the price down to $47,500.

In this scenario, Tom's original offer to sell the business for $50,000 was a firm offer, meaning it was irrevocable for 6 weeks. Even though Alex made a counteroffer, Tom's original offer remained in effect until the end of the 6-week period. However, once the 6 weeks expired, Tom's offer was no longer firm, and he was free to reject or accept Alex's counteroffer or make a new offer."
First-sale doctrine	"The first-sale doctrine (also sometimes referred to as the ""right of first sale"" or the ""first sale rule"") is a legal concept that limits the rights of an intellectual property owner to control resale of products embodying its intellectual property. The doctrine enables the distribution chain of copyrighted products, library lending, giving, video rentals and secondary markets for copyrighted works (for example, enabling individuals to sell their legally purchased books or CDs to others). In trademark law, this same doctrine enables reselling of trademarked products after the trademark holder puts the products on the market. In the case of patented products, the doctrine allows resale of patented products without any control from the patent holder.  The first sale doctrine does not apply to patented processes, which are instead governed by the patent exhaustion doctrine."	"As a young music lover, Emma had been saving up for months to buy her favorite band's latest album, ""Electric Storm"". She finally splurged on the CD and eagerly ripped it open to give it a first listen. The album did not disappoint - she played it nonstop for weeks, singing along to every song.

One day, Emma decided to sell her beloved CD to her friend, Alex, who was also a huge fan of the band. Emma had never lent it to anyone, and the CD was still in excellent condition. As they made the exchange, Alex asked Emma why she was getting rid of the album. Emma replied that she wanted to fund her college tuition and needed some extra cash.

Alex was thrilled to get the album and promptly added it to his collection. He never made a copy of the CD or shared it with anyone. He simply enjoyed listening to it whenever he wanted. Unbeknownst to Alex, the band's record label, Storm Music, owned the copyright to the album.

Under the first-sale doctrine, Storm Music's rights to control the distribution and sale of ""Electric Storm"" were exhausted when they initially released the album to the public. Emma was free to sell the CD to Alex, and once she did, Storm Music had no say in the matter. Alex, as a good-faith buyer, could freely play and enjoy the album, without infringing on any copyrights. The first-sale doctrine allowed the music lovers to continue enjoying their favorite band's music, while also respecting the rights of the copyright holders."
Fleeing felon rule	"In common law, the fleeing felon rule permits the use of force, including deadly force, against an individual who is suspected of a felony and is in clear flight.

"	"Here's a story illustrating the fleeing felon rule:

It was a crisp autumn evening in suburban Ohio. Officer Jameson was on patrol when he spotted a man in a nearby alleyway. The man, later identified as 28-year-old Jake, noticed Jameson's approach and began running. Jake had reportedly been involved in a robbery at a nearby convenience store a few minutes prior.

Officer Jameson's training and instincts kicked in, and he immediately pursued Jake on foot. As he gained on the fleeing suspect, Jameson yelled for Jake to stop. Instead, Jake sprinted faster, diving behind a row of dumpsters.

As he stood up, Jameson could see Jake holding a small, rectangular item in hand and shouting ""leave me alone!"" Jameson's experience told him that the item looked like a stolen tablet. He also noted that Jake was clearly trying to evade capture by hiding behind a barrier and shouting for Jameson to leave him be.

Jameson immediately assessed the situation and decided to use deadly force. He shot Jake once, stopping him in his tracks. A subsequent investigation revealed that Jake was indeed the perpetrator of the convenience store robbery, and the stolen item was the store's security camera that was used to incriminate himself and others involved in the robbery.

Officer Jameson followed procedure and remained at the scene until backup arrived. The investigation reiterated that the use of deadly force was valid due to the clear flight involved."
Floodgates principle	"The floodgates principle, or the floodgates argument, is a legal principle which is sometimes applied by judges to restrict or limit the right to make claims for damages because of a concern that permitting a claimant to recover in such situations might open the metaphorical ""floodgates"" to large numbers of claims and lawsuits.  The principle is most frequently cited in common law jurisdictions, and in English tort law in particular.
Most of the situations in which the courts have employed the floodgates argument have revolved around liability in tort, and in particular in relation to the liability for nervous shock or for pure economic loss. The rationale in which the floodgates principle has been applied may vary. In some cases it is expressed to be a constraint upon when a defendant will owe a duty of care, in others it is expressed to be a limitation upon the remoteness of damage for which a defendant should be held responsible for.  In other cases it is simply stated as a principle of public policy.
The floodgates principle is arguably the antithesis of the legal maxim: fiat justitia ruat caelum (""let justice be done though the heavens fall"")."	"Meet Emma, a loyal employee at a local newspaper, who had been a enthusiastic fan of the city's beloved football team, the Thunderbolts. On a fateful evening, the Thunderbolts' stadium erupted in a massive fireworks display, and the report of a loud explosion sent shockwaves throughout the city. Emma, who was sitting in her office approximately 5 miles away from the stadium, suffered a mild anxiety attack and had to take a few days off work.

The government's fireworks vendor, Sparkles Inc., was sued by Emma for emotional distress. Emma's lawyer argued that Sparkles Inc. had a duty of care to ensure that the fireworks display did not cause harm to people beyond the stadium area. The judge, concerned that if Emma won her case, it could open the floodgates to a tidal wave of similar lawsuits, ruled in favor of Sparkles Inc., stating that the burden on the defendant was too great and the potential for nuisance claims overwhelming.

In this scenario, the judge applied the floodgates principle to restrict Emma's claim, worrying that a precedent would be set, allowing anyone who experienced anxiety or distress from a loud noise complaint to sue. The judge's concern was that multiple claims would flood the courts, making it difficult to defend and potentially crippling the defendant. This demonstrated the floodgates principle in action, where the court weighs the potential for excessive litigation against the interests of the claimant."
Forum non conveniens	"Forum non conveniens (FNC; Latin for 'an inconvenient forum') is a mostly common law legal doctrine through which a court acknowledges that another forum or court where the case might have been brought is a more appropriate venue for a legal case, and dismisses the case. Forum non conveniens may be used to dismiss a case, for example, to encourage parties to file a case in another jurisdiction within which an accident or incident underlying the litigation occurred and where all the witnesses reside.
As a doctrine of the conflict of laws, forum non conveniens applies between courts in different countries and between courts in different jurisdictions in the same country. Forum non conveniens is not applicable between counties or federal districts within a state.
A concern often raised in applications of the doctrine is forum shopping, or picking a court merely to gain an advantage in the proceeding. This concern is balanced against the public policy of deferring to a plaintiff's choice of venue in claims where there may be more than one appropriate jurisdiction. The underlying principles, such as basing respect given to foreign courts on reciprocal respect or comity, also apply in civil law systems in the form of the legal doctrine of lis alibi pendens.
Forum non conveniens is not exclusive to common law nations: the maritime courts of the Republic of Panama, although not a common law jurisdiction, also have such power under more restrained conditions."	"John, a US citizen, was involved in a car accident while on vacation in Spain. He filed a lawsuit against Maria, the other driver, in a California court, claiming damages for his injuries. However, Maria is a Spanish national and resides in Barcelona. All the key witnesses, including the ambulance crew and police officers, were also Spanish.

After reviewing the case, the California court considered that a Spanish court would be a more convenient and appropriate forum for the case. The court took into account that Maria was a Spanish resident and would have to travel to the US to participate in the proceedings, which would be a significant burden. Additionally, most of the evidence was gathered in Spain, and the Spanish court would have better access to these witnesses.

The California court applied the doctrine of forum non conveniens and dismissed John's lawsuit. John was unhappy with the decision and appealed, but the higher court upheld the decision.

This story illustrates how the doctrine of forum non conveniens works. In this case, the California court recognized that a Spanish court would be a more convenient and appropriate venue for the lawsuit, and therefore dismissed the case. This decision allows Maria to defend herself in her home country, which is more practical and efficient. The doctrine ensures that litigation is done in a fair and efficient manner, avoiding unnecessary inconvenience and costs."
Fruit of the poisonous tree	"Fruit of the poisonous tree is a legal metaphor used to describe evidence that is obtained illegally. The logic of the terminology is that if the source (the ""tree"") of the evidence or evidence itself is tainted, then anything gained (the ""fruit"") from it is tainted as well."	"Meet Sarah, a small-town baker who runs a popular bakery downtown. One day, the local police detective, Jack, wakes up and decides to pay Sarah a visit, allegedly to inquire about a minor discrepancy in her bakery's tax return. However, during the ""chat,"" Jack pressures Sarah into agreeing to give him a ""favor"" – she lets him take a look around her bakery, stating that it's a ""routine inspection.""

Unbeknownst to Sarah, Jack is looking for evidence to pin a serious crime on a local competitor, the owners of which Gordon's Gourmet, a rival bakery across town. Jack 'finds' a incriminating document on Sarah's desk – a draft of a disparaging review of Gordon's Gourmet, which had been left on Sarah's desk by mistake.

This document becomes crucial evidence in a subsequent trial against Gordon's Gourmet, as the prosecution uses it to 'prove' that Sarah was planning to sabotage the competition. However, Jack's initial detention of Sarah, the 'search' of her bakery, and the 'discovery' of the incriminating document are all deemed unlawful by the court.

The document, which was the 'fruit,' is deemed inadmissible as evidence because it was obtained through Jack's illegal actions. If the 'tree' (the original, illegal search) is poisonous, so is the 'fruit' (the evidence). The prosecution is left without sufficient evidence, and Gordon's Gourmet is ultimately acquitted. This outcome illustrates the concept of 'Fruit of the Poissonous Tree' – if evidence is obtained illegally, it is generally considered tainted and inadmissible in court."
Frustration of purpose	"Frustration of purpose, in law, is a defense to enforcement of a contract. Frustration of purpose occurs when an unforeseen event undermines a party's principal purpose for entering into a contract such that the performance of the contract is radically different from performance of the contract that was originally contemplated by both parties, and both parties knew of the principal purpose at the time the contract was made. Despite frequently arising as a result of government action, any third party or even nature can frustrate a contracting party's primary purpose for entering into the contract. The concept is also called commercial frustration.
For example, suppose Joe gets a mortgage for a new home, and after three years, the home is destroyed, through no fault of Joe's. Without a hell or high water clause, Joe might be exempt from the remainder of the mortgage due to frustration of purpose, as the principal purpose of the contract, to have a home to live in, has been compromised. However, he might still have a foreclosure on his credit rating.
Frustration of purpose is often confused with the closely related doctrine of impossibility. The distinction is that impossibility concerns the duties specified in the contract, but frustration of purpose concerns the reason a party entered into the contract. For example, imagine that entrepreneur Emily leases space from landlord Larry so that she can open a restaurant that serves only Tibetan Speckled Lizard meat. If the city rezones the property to forbid commercial uses or if the property is destroyed by a tornado, both Larry and Emily are excused from performing the contract by impossibility.
However, if the Tibetan Speckled Lizard suddenly goes extinct, Emily may be excused from performing the contract because Larry knew her primary purpose for entering into the lease was to serve Tibetan Speckled Lizard, and the purpose has been frustrated. In the second scenario, the parties could still carry out their obligations under the lease, but one of them no longer has a reason to.
The Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 265, defines frustration of purpose:

Where, after a contract is made, a party's principal purpose is substantially frustrated without his fault by the occurrence of an event the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made, his remaining duties to render performance are discharged, unless the language or circumstances [of the contract] indicate the contrary.
A circumstance is not deemed to be a ""basic assumption on which the contract is made"" unless the change in circumstances could not have been reasonably foreseen at the time the contract was made. As a result, it is rarely invoked successfully. Successful invocations usually come in waves during times of substantial tumult, such as after the passage of Prohibition, when bars and taverns no longer had a reason for their leases, or during major wars, when demand for many consumer goods and services drops far below what is normal.
If the defense is successfully invoked, the contract is terminated, and the parties are left as they are at the time of the litigation."	"As the sun rose over the small coastal town of Bayport, Local News Café's owner, Rachel, was busy preparing for the day's rush. The café had been a staple in the community for over 20 years, and Rachel had recently signed a 10-year lease extension to ensure the business remained a hub for locals and tourists alike.

But little did Rachel know, a devastating oil spill just off the coast would soon devastate the town's main fishing industry. The authorities announced a state of emergency, and the local fishermen were forced to shut down their operations.

As the days passed, the usually bustling harbour became quiet, and the townspeople struggled to make ends meet. Rachel's daily caffeine-fueled crowds disappeared, and her business was on the brink of collapse. She had signed the lease extension with the intention of catering to the fishermen and their families, but now that purpose was substantially frustrated.

Rachel's landlord, Jack, was initially unfazed, insisting that the lease remained in effect. But Rachel argued that the unforeseen event had fundamentally changed the purpose of the contract. Jack had known that the café's success relied on serving the fishing community; now that purpose had been destroyed.

Ultimately, a judge agreed with Rachel, ruling that the oil spill had frustrated the purpose of the contract, and she was no longer obligated to pay rent. While the decision provided relief, it also highlighted the devastating impact of the environmental disaster on the small town and its citizens. Rachel's story serves as a poignant reminder of the legal concept of frustration of purpose, where unforeseen events can radically alter the basis of a contract, rendering performance impossible or meaningless."
FTC v. Dean Foods Co.	"FTC v. Dean Foods Co., 384 U.S. 597 (1966), is a 1966 decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) may sue in federal court to obtain a preliminary injunction to maintain the status quo against the consummation of a merger that the agency persuasively contends violates the antitrust laws.
More broadly, the Dean Foods case stands for the proposition that a federal agency may, by invoking the ""All Writs Act,"" seek equitable relief in federal court against a person's threatened action that will substantially interfere with the agency's performance of its statutory duty and thus adversely affect the relevant court's ability to review the agency's ultimate order with respect to the threatened action."	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of FTC v. Dean Foods Co.:

Imagine a small, independent bookstore called ""Page Turners"" is located in a bustling downtown area. The bookstore, owned by Sarah, is a beloved fixture in the community, offering a curated selection of rare and local author books. One day, Sarah announces that she has signed a deal with a large, national bookstore chain called ""BookWorld"" to sell Page Turners to them. BookWorld plans to close Page Turners' doors within 60 days, get rid of most of the staff, and create a generic store with a limited selection of books.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is concerned that this acquisition would significantly reduce competition in the area, eliminating a unique business that serviced the local community. The FTC would have to navigate the complex merger review process, which could take months, and by that time, BookWorld would have likely gutted Page Turners.

To stop this from happening, the FTC seeks help from a federal district court. The court, under the All Writs Act, grants the FTC a ""',injunction prohibiting BookWorld from consummating the acquisition until the FTC can fully review the merger and make a finding as to its legality under the antitrust laws."" This ensures the status quo is preserved, preventing BookWorld from shutting down Page Turners and eliminating the competitive bookstore. The court is effectively saying, ""This isn't over yet! We need to examine whether this acquisition follows the rules."""
Functionality doctrine	"Under United States trademark law, the functionality doctrine provides that product features that are functional cannot be protected as trademarks. A product feature is considered functional if it is essential to the product’s use or purpose, or if it has an impact on the product’s cost or quality. The purpose of the doctrine is to encourage legitimate competition by ensuring a balance between trademark law and patent law.
A key case illustrating the functionality doctrine is Traffix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc. (2001). In this case, the Supreme Court held that a dual-spring design for a road sign was not eligible for trade dress protection—a category within trademark law—because it served a purpose beyond “informing consumers that the sign stands are made by” the plaintiff.
There are two branches of the functionality doctrine: utilitarian functionality and aesthetic functionality. The rationale behind functionality doctrine is that product markets would not be truly competitive if newcomers could not make a product with a feature that consumers demand. Utilitarian functionality provides grounds to deny federal trademark protection to product features which do something useful.  Patent law, not trademark, protects useful processes, machines, and material inventions.  Patented designs are presumed to be functional until proven otherwise.  Aesthetic functionality  provides grounds to deny trademark protection to design features which are included to make the product more aesthetically appealing and commercially desirable.  Aesthetic features are within the purview of copyright law, which provides protection to creative and original works of authorship."	"Meet Emma, a successful yoga instructor who has built a loyal following with her signature ""ZenTree"" brand of yoga mats. Her mats feature a unique design with a curved edge and contrasting color scheme, which Emma claims is a trademarked trade dress.

However, a new yoga mat company, called ""NamasteNow,"" enters the market and releases a nearly identical mat design. Emma sues NamasteNow, arguing that their design infringes on her trademarked trade dress.

The court disagrees, citing the functionality doctrine. The judge explains that the curved edge and contrasting colors are functional features that serve a purpose beyond identifying Emma's brand. The curved edge provides a comfortable grip for yogis, while the contrasting colors make it easier to clean the mat. These features are essential to the mat's use and purpose, and therefore cannot be protected as a trademark.

NamasteNow can produce a similar design without infringing on Emma's trademark rights because their design serves the same functional purposes as Emma's. The court finds that Emma's claim is unfounded, and NamasteNow is free to create and sell their own branded yoga mats with a similar design.

In this scenario, the functionality doctrine protects the competitive market by allowing others to create products that serve similar purposes as Emma's yoga mats, while still maintaining their own distinct branding and design elements."
Fundamental breach	"Fundamental breach of contract, is a controversial concept within the common law of contract. The doctrine was, in particular, nurtured by Lord Denning, Master of the Rolls from 1962 to 1982, but it did not find favour with the House of Lords.
Whereas breach of condition is a serious breach that ""denies the plaintiff the main benefit of the contract"", fundamental breach was supposed to be even worse, with the result that any exclusion clause limiting the defendant's liability would automatically become void and ineffective. Also, whereas breach of condition gives the plaintiff the option to repudiate, fundamental breach automatically discharges the entire contract.
Although the concept caused some excitement in the 1950s and 1960s, the concept was regarded as flawed by the Law Lords, whose decision in the Suisse Atlantique case substantially curtailed the doctrine, which has now been effectively abandoned in England and Canada. The relevant concept in English Law, where a fundamental aspect of a contract is breached, is repudiatory breach."	"The sun was shining bright on the wedding day, but little did Sarah know, the cake supplier, Emma, was late in delivering the three-tier masterpiece. As she arrived at the venue, she frantically called Emma's team, only to be told that the cake had been accidentally destroyed in a bakery accident the night before.

Sarah was devastated. The wedding cake was not only a centerpiece for the guests but also a symbol of love and commitment between her and her fiancé. Emma apologized profusely and promised to deliver a new cake, albeit a smaller one, but Sarah was not convinced.

In the eyes of the law, Emma's actions constituted a fundamental breach of contract. Not only did she fail to provide the main benefit of the contract – a beautiful wedding cake – but her careless mistake denied Sarah and her fiancé the opportunity to enjoy the celebratory meal. The contract's exclusion clause, which limited Emma's liability in case of accidental damage, would be rendered void due to the severity of the breach.

As a result, Sarah was entitled to cancel the entire contract and seek damages from Emma. Emma's mistake was not just a simple error, but a fundamental breakdown of the contract's core purpose. This breach went beyond a straightforward breach of condition, as it had a direct and devastating impact on the success of the wedding. It was a fundamental breach that led to the complete collapse of the contract."
Fundamental principles recognized by the laws of the Republic	"In France, the fundamental principles recognized by the laws of the Republic (French: principes fondamentaux reconnus par les lois de la République, abbreviated to PFRLR) are certain principles recognized by the Constitutional Council and the Council of State as having constitutional force.
This concept is mentioned briefly in the preamble of the Constitution of 1946. The preamble of the constitution of 1958 references the 1946 preamble, and the constitutional judges, in their ""freedom of association"" ruling, decision n°71-44 DC of 16 July 1971, gave constitutional force to this preamble."	"Here is a short story that illustrates the concept of ""Fundamental principles recognized by the laws of the Republic"":

Marseille, France, 2010. Dr. Maria, a renowned pediatrician, had spent years building a reputation for her progressive approach to child healthcare. She believed that every child deserved equal access to medical care, regardless of their family's economic situation. Maria had vocalized her concerns about the gaps in the public healthcare system, leading to whispers of discontent among local hospital administrators.

One sunny afternoon, Maria received an unexpected visit from the hospital's director, Monsieur Dupont. He explained that due to budget constraints, the hospital was no longer able to provide free consultations to underprivileged families. Maria argued that this decision was in stark contrast to the fundamental principles of equality and social solidarity enshrined in the French Constitution. She insisted that every citizen, regardless of their socio-economic status, had the right to equal access to healthcare.

Monsieur Dupont countered that the decision was purely financial and aimed to improve the hospital's financial sustainability. Maria retorted that the French Republic's fundamental principles transcended financial considerations. After a heated debate, Monsieur Dupont reluctantly agreed to reconsider the hospital's policy, citing the importance of upholding the fundamental principles recognized by the laws of the Republic.

This incident highlights the tension between economic necessity and the pursuit of social justice, demonstrating how the concept of ""Fundamental principles recognized by the laws of the Republic"" guides day-to-day decision-making, even in seemingly intractable situations. By invoking these principles, Dr. Maria stood up for the values that France upholds as essential to its constitutional order, ensuring that the pursuit of social solidarity and equality remained a cornerstone of French society."
General principles of European Union law	"The general principles of European Union law are general principles of law which are applied by the European Court of Justice and the national courts of the member states when determining the lawfulness of legislative and administrative measures within the European Union. General principles of European Union law may be derived from common legal principles in the various EU member states, or general principles found in international law or European Union law. General principles of law should be distinguished from rules of law as principles are more general and open-ended in the sense that they need to be honed to be applied to specific cases with correct results.
The general principles of European Union law are rules of law which a European Union judge, sitting for example in the European Court of Justice, has to find and apply but not create. Particularly for fundamental rights, Article 6(3) of the Treaty on European Union provided:

Fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, shall constitute general principles of the Union's law.
Further, Article 340 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (formerly Article 215 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community) expressly provides for the application of the ""general principles common to the laws of the Member States"" in the case of non-contractual liability.
In practice the European Court of Justice has applied general principles to all aspects of European Union law. In formulating general principles, European Union judges draw on a variety of sources, including: public international law and its general principles inherent to all legal systems; national laws of the member states, that is general principles common to the laws of all member states, general principles inferred from European Union law, and fundamental human rights. General principles are found and applied to avoid the denial of justice, fill gaps in European Union law and to strengthen the coherence of European Union law.
Accepted general principles of European Union Law include fundamental rights, proportionality, legal certainty, equality before the law, primacy of European Union law and subsidiarity. In Case T-74/00 Artegodan, the General Court (then Court of First Instance) appeared willing to extrapolate from the limited provision for the precautionary principle in environmental policy in Article 191(2) TFEU to a general principle of EU law."	"Meet Emma, a young entrepreneur who has founded a company that produces eco-friendly cleaning products. Her products are popular among environmentally-conscious consumers, and her company has grown rapidly. However, a new EU regulation is proposed, requiring all cleaning products to undergo rigorous testing and certification before hitting the market. Emma is worried that this new regulation will hinder her company's growth and make it difficult for her to stay competitive.

As the proposal goes to the EU Parliament for approval, Emma notices that the proposed regulation seems to prioritize large corporations over small businesses like hers. She decides to take action and files a complaint with the European Court of Justice, arguing that the regulation violates the principle of equal treatment before the law (one of the general principles of European Union law).

The EU Court carefully reviews the case and determines that the proposed regulation is indeed discriminatory and fails to consider the specific needs of small businesses. The Court draws on the general principles of EU law, including the principle of proportionality, which requires that any legislative measure must be proportionate to its intended goal.

The Court rules that the regulation must be revised to prioritize fairness and equality before the law for all businesses, regardless of their size. Emma's complaint is sustained, and her company is allowed to continue operating without undue burdens. This case illustrates how the general principles of European Union law are applied to ensure that EU legislation is fair, proportionate, and respects the rights of all citizens."
Good faith	In human interactions, good faith (Latin: bona fidēs) is a sincere intention to be fair, open, and honest, regardless of the outcome of the interaction. Some Latin phrases have lost their literal meaning over centuries, but that is not the case with bona fides, which is still widely used and interchangeable with its generally accepted modern-day English translation of good faith. It is an important concept within law and business. The opposed concepts are bad faith, mala fides (duplicity) and perfidy (pretense).	"Meet Emma, the owner of a small independent bookstore in a quaint town. She had been running her business for years, and it had become a beloved gathering spot for book lovers and community events.

One day, a wealthy developer, Mark, approached Emma with a proposal to demolish her store and build a new high-rise condominium complex. Mark presented his plan as a ""revitalization"" effort, promising that the new development would bring in new businesses and jobs to the area.

At first, Emma was hesitant, but Mark's charming demeanor and promises of community benefits eventually won her over. She agreed to sell the property, thinking that the developer would indeed deliver on his promises.

However, as construction began, Emma realized that Mark had no intention of keeping his word. The new development would push her beloved bookstore out of business, and the developer was more interested in maximizing profits than building a community hub.

In court, Emma sued Mark for breach of contract, arguing that he had acted in bad faith by making false promises and hiding his true intentions. The judge ruled in Emma's favor, citing that Mark had not acted with good faith by making promises he had no intention of keeping. The court's decision emphasized the importance of genuine intent and honesty in business dealings.

In this scenario, Emma's good faith was evident in her willingness to listen to Mark's proposal and give him the benefit of the doubt. On the other hand, Mark's bad faith was evident in his insincere intentions and false promises. The case highlights the importance of good faith in business dealings, emphasizing the need for honesty, transparency, and a genuine willingness to collaborate for the greater good."
Good-faith exception	"In United States constitutional law and criminal procedure, the good-faith exception (also good-faith doctrine) is one of the limitations on the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment.
For criminal proceedings, the exclusionary rule prohibits entry of evidence obtained through an unreasonable search and seizure, such as one executed under an invalid search warrant. However, the good-faith exemption allows evidence collected by law enforcement officers pursuant to a defective search warrant if the officers reasonably relied on the validity of the warrant in good faith (bona fides)."	"Samantha recently moved into a cozy little house on a quiet street. One morning, she woke up to find her neighborhood transformed into a crime scene. Police were swarming her home, and officers were rummaging through her belongings. They explained that they had a search warrant, allowing them to investigate a string of burglaries in the area.

Samantha was shaken, but she cooperated with the investigation, letting the officers collect evidence and interview her. Later, she learned that the warrant was defective – the magistrate who issued it didn't have jurisdiction to grant it.

As the evidence collected during the search might be excluded from trial due to the invalid warrant, Samantha's case was dismissed, and the burglars went free. The prosecutor appealed, arguing that since the officers reasonably relied on the warrant, believing it to be valid at the time, they should not be punished for the mistakes of others.

The court agreed, applying the good-faith exception. Although the warrant was defective, the officers' actions were lawful and in good faith. The evidence collected was still admissible in court.

Samantha was frustrated but understood the reasoning. She knew that the officers were human and had acted sincerely, relying on the warrant's validity. She moved on, focusing on healing and rebuilding her life."
Gravi de pugna	Gravi de pugna is a forged letter written in the name of Augustine of Hippo which asserts that the morally superior side is always superior in battle and therefore that wars are proven to be just wars by their military success. The letter was widely accepted as authentic, and reassured soldiers that God was on their side.	"As the battle-hardened commander, Colonel Thompson, gazed out at his weary troops, he couldn't help but feel a surge of confidence. It wasn't just his well-trained men or the superior tactics they employed, but something more – a sense of divine backing. A sly smile spread across his face as he recalled the ancient letter he had found in the dusty archives of his college. It was a letter attributed to the revered Saint Augustine, claiming that in times of war, the morally superior side always emerged victorious.

The letter, known as the ""Ad Petraeum"" or ""Letter to Petrus,"" was a powerful force multiplier. It reassured Thompson's troops that God was on their side, imbuing them with a sense of righteousness and purpose. As they charged into battle, they felt an unshakeable faith that justice would prevail. The enemy, on the other hand, began to doubt their cause, beset by self-doubt and fear of divine retribution.

As the dust settled, and the enemy lines crumbled, Thompson's troops emerged victorious. The letter had once again validated the notion of ""just war."" It seemed that Saint Augustine, in his wisdom, had issued a clarion call to soldiers everywhere, ensuring that those who fought with moral conviction would always emerge triumphant. Thompson, with a mix of satisfaction and unease, realized that the power of words could hold immense sway over the battlefield, and that the authenticity of the letter – or the lack thereof – could have far-reaching consequences."
Greenhouse effect (United States Supreme Court)	"The Greenhouse effect is a theory of U.S. Supreme Court justices' behavior that postulates a tendency of conservative Supreme Court Justices to vote with the liberals more often as their careers progress, due to a desire for favorable press coverage. The idea was first proposed by Hoover Institution economist Thomas Sowell and popularized by D.C. Court of Appeals Senior Judge Laurence Silberman in a speech to The Federalist Society in 1992. Silberman said, ""It seems that the primary objective of The Times's legal reporters is to put activist heat on recently appointed Supreme Court justices.""
The term ""Greenhouse"" refers to Linda Greenhouse, a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter who covered the Supreme Court for the New York Times for 40 years. The existence of the Greenhouse effect has been challenged by some commentators, who note it presumes a ""vast, hegemonic liberal control over the media and academia"" and question whether professional decision makers who have ""come to their views despite years of elite education and exposure to elite opinion"" are really so malleable. 
However, the evidence below suggests that conservative justices become liberal more often than liberals become conservative. Further, the existence of a more general version of the Greenhouse effect, one not restricted to the media but rather ""elites"" in general or legal elites, is less controversial. Though this does not show causation, 75% of law professors who began their careers after 1986 identify as liberal, while only 10% identify as conservative. Evidence suggests more ""elite"" journalists identify as liberal than conservative."	"Here's a story that illustrates the Greenhouse effect:

Meet Emily, a young and ambitious lawyer who was appointed to the Supreme Court just a few years ago. As a conservative, Emily was expected to toe the party line and vote in line with her fellow conservatives. However, as she began to make her decisions on the bench, Emily started to notice that the media was paying close attention to her votes. Headlines like ""Conservative Justice Shifts Stance on Abortion"" and ""Supreme Court Surprise: Conservative Turns Liberal on Same-Sex Marriage"" were common.

Despite her initial reservations, Emily began to feel pressure from her colleagues and the public to moderate her views and vote more in line with the liberal bloc. She started to receive calls from liberal advocates and legal scholars, praising her for her newfound ""open-mindedness"" and ""willingness to listen to both sides."" Emily also noticed that her conservative colleagues seemed to be getting more conservative with age, while liberal colleagues were remaining steadfast in their views.

As the years passed, Emily found herself voting more and more in line with the liberal bloc, often surprising even herself with her newfound ""liberal leanings."" Her conservative colleagues began to view her with suspicion, wondering what had gotten into her. Emily herself wondered if she had simply grown wiser with age, or if the constant drumbeat of media scrutiny and pressure from liberal elites had changed her perspective. Whatever the reason, Emily had become a key swing vote on the court, much to the delight of the liberal stronghold and the dismay of her conservative colleagues."
Habitability	"Habitability is the adequacy of an environment for human living. Where housing is concerned, there are generally local ordinances which define habitability. If a residence complies with those laws, it is said to be habitable. In extreme environments, such as space exploration, habitability must take into account psychological and social stressors, due to the harsh nature of the environment.

"	"Maria had been looking forward to moving into her new apartment for weeks. She had signed a lease on a cozy two-bedroom unit in a moderate-cost complex, convinced by the landlord's promises of a ""beautiful view"" and ""recent renovations."" But as soon as she stepped inside, she knew something was off.

The air was thick with the smell of mold, and the walls were cracking in multiple spots. The kitchen was tiny, with ancient appliances that seemed to be held together by tape and prayers. And the ""beautiful view"" turned out to be a wall of graffiti-covered concrete directly outside the window.

As Maria unpacked, she began to notice other issues. The bathroom sink wouldn't stop leaking, the floors were slippery with water damage, and the windows refused to open more than a crack. Feeling uneasy, she contacted her landlord, who insisted that the apartment was ""perfectly habitable"" because it met the local minimum standards.

But Maria knew better. She had always been particular about her living space, and this apartment was far from tolerable. When she Googled the local ordinances, she discovered that habitability standards extended far beyond mere compliance with building codes. Factors like safety, sanitation, and overall comfort were also taken into account.

Convinced that her landlord was being negligent, Maria decided to seek legal advice. She learned that if a residence fails to meet these broader habitability standards, the tenant has the right to request repairs or, in extreme cases, even terminate the lease. With newfound confidence, Maria negotiated the landlord's agreement to fix the issues, ensuring that her new home would finally become a place she could truly call her own."
Homestead principle	"The homestead principle is the principle by which one gains ownership of an unowned natural resource by performing an act of original appropriation. Appropriation could be enacted by putting an unowned resource to active use (as with using it to produce some product),
joining it with previously acquired property, or by marking it as owned (as with livestock branding).
Homesteading is one of the foundations of Rothbardian anarcho-capitalism and right-libertarianism."	"Here's a short story:

**The Abandoned Mine**: Rural Alaska

The sun sets over the vast Alaskan wilderness, casting a golden glow over the rolling tundra. Ben Hawley, an itinerant prospector, has been traversing the frozen terrain for weeks in search of precious minerals to stake a claim. As he rounds a bend in the horizon, he stumbles upon an abandoned mine,LEFT unsecured and seemingly unclaimed. For decades, the mine had laid dormant, though rumors whispered among locals that its tunnels now held a valuable vein of rare copper.

Ben decides to make use of the mine, pitching in a new tunnel and fixing the ramshackle wooden infrastructure. Weeks turn into months, and Ben spends every spare moment hauling ore out of the mine, eventually refining it in a makeshift facility on the main road.

Hub-and-spoke conspiracy	"A hub-and-spoke conspiracy (or hub-and-spokes conspiracy) is a legal construct or doctrine of United States antitrust and criminal law. In such a conspiracy, several parties (""spokes"") enter into an unlawful agreement with a leading party (""hub""). The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit explained the concept in these terms:

In a ""hub-and-spoke conspiracy,"" a central mastermind, or ""hub,"" controls numerous ""spokes,"" or secondary co-conspirators. These co-conspirators participate in independent transactions with the individual or group of individuals at the ""hub"" that collectively further a single, illegal enterprise.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit explained the concept in these terms:

Such a conspiracy involves a hub, generally the dominant purchaser or supplier in the relevant market, and the spokes, made up of the distributors involved in the conspiracy. The rim of the wheel is the connecting agreements among the horizontal competitors (distributors) that form the spokes.
The antitrust cases often emphasize the importance of interdependence among the spokes and their recognition of one another. The general criminal cases, such as narcotics conspiracy prosecutions, tend to require only a more general knowledge among the spokes that there is a larger overall unlawful scheme involving other actors who are cooperating with the hub in carrying out the scheme. It is controversial, particularly in the antitrust cases, how much knowledge spoke actors must have of the conduct of other spoke actors—which is to say how much of a ""rim"" must be put around the ""wheel"" of the hub-and-spoke conspiracy for it to be a single conspiracy rather than many separate ""vertical"" conspiracies. There is a controversy and some uncertainty over the legal status of the ""rimless"" conspiracy—one with very limited interaction among the spokes."	"Here is a story illustrating the concept of a hub-and-spoke conspiracy:

In the city's vibrant tech scene, Alex, a successful app developer and founder of a popular platform, ""TwinPulse,"" sat at the center of a bustling ecosystem. Alex was known for gig-finding services for freelance developers, connecting them to high-paying projects. Alex would ensure that only the best projects were listed on their platform, thereby controlling the market.

Several smaller app developers, led by individuals named Leo, May, and Siddharth, had heard about Alex's lucrative deals. Without knowing about their own rival firms, each of these developers would occasionally contact Alex about top-secret projects. For example, Leo would show Alex a lucrative coding project; May would offer a premium designation for their popular game; Siddharth would present an updated plug-in source code, and Alex would manipulate the interface so that his application became the required necessary component for success.

These local app developers were not in regular contact with one another. None of them collaborated directly, nor did they realize their patterns mimicked the same exchange tactics that certainly favored Alex. For their part, each app developer only expected funneling their possible, high-paying clients to Alex's aggregator platform, hoping to snap a high percentage of these lucrative arrangements.

It remains unclear how much interdependence each developer should have recognized or else have understood the actually unknowledgeable scheme practiced by all of the involved actors."
Human rights	"Human rights are universally recognized moral principles or norms that establish standards of human behavior and are often protected by both national and international laws. These rights are considered inherent and inalienable, meaning they belong to every individual simply by virtue of being human, regardless of characteristics like nationality, ethnicity, religion, or socio-economic status. They encompass a broad range of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, such as the right to life, freedom of expression, protection against enslavement, and right to education.
The modern concept of human rights gained significant prominence after World War II, particularly in response to the atrocities of the Holocaust, leading to the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. This document outlined a comprehensive framework of rights that countries are encouraged to protect, setting a global standard for human dignity, freedom, and justice. The UDHR has since inspired numerous international treaties and national laws designed to promote and safeguard these rights globally.
While the principle of universal human rights is widely accepted, debates persist regarding which rights should take precedence, how they should be implemented, and their applicability in different cultural contexts. Criticisms often arise from perspectives like cultural relativism, which argue that individual human rights are inappropriate for societies that prioritise a communal or collectivist identity, and may conflict with certain cultural or traditional practices.
Nonetheless, human rights remain a central focus in international relations and legal frameworks, supported by institutions such as the United Nations, various non-governmental organizations, and national bodies dedicated to monitoring and enforcing human rights standards worldwide.

"	"**The Case of Maria and the Local Newspaper**

In a small town in a developing country, Maria, a bright and ambitious young journalist, was known for her fearless reporting on social issues. She had been investigating a series of land grabs by the local government, which had left many families homeless. Her articles sparked outrage and calls for reform.

However, the government, feeling threatened, began to harass and intimidate Maria, refusing to renew her press credentials and warning her to stop writing about the issue. They even threatened her with arrest. Undeterred, Maria continued to write about the injustices, but the local newspaper that published her work started to receive disconcerting phone calls and visits from the authorities.

One day, Maria was approached by a group of elders from her community, who asked her to speak only in hushed tones. They explained that they had been following her work and were impressed by her courage, but they also expressed concern that her press freedom and right to free speech were being trampled upon. Maria listened intently, and together, they came up with a plan to appeal to the local human rights commission for protection.

With the commission's support, Maria was able to continue reporting on the land seizures, and eventually, the government was forced to back down and address the injustices. The case served as a beacon for the community, highlighting the importance of protecting the fundamental rights, enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to freedom of speech, expression, and association, which are essential for a vibrant democracy."
Idea–expression distinction	"The idea–expression distinction or idea–expression dichotomy is a legal doctrine in the United States that limits the scope of copyright protection by differentiating an idea from the expression or manifestation of that idea.
Unlike patents, which may confer proprietary rights in relation to general ideas and concepts per se when construed as methods, copyrights cannot confer such rights.  An adventure novel provides an illustration of the concept. Copyright may subsist in the work as a whole, in the particular story or characters involved, or in any artwork contained in the book, but generally not in the idea or genre of the story. Copyright, therefore, may not subsist in the idea of a man venturing out on a quest, but may subsist in a particular story that follows that pattern. Similarly, if the methods or processes described in a work are patentable, they may be the subject of various patent claims, which may or may not be broad enough to cover other methods or processes based on the same idea. Arthur C. Clarke, for example, sufficiently described the concept of a communications satellite (a geostationary satellite used as a telecommunications relay) in a 1945 paper that was not considered patentable in 1954 when it was developed at Bell Labs."	"It was a sunny Saturday afternoon when best friends, Emma and Ryan, decided to start brainstorming ideas for their next novel. Over coffee and creative energy, they tossed around concepts, characters, and plotlines. Emma's eyes lit up as she exclaimed, ""What if we wrote about a quest to find the world's most elusive treasure?"" Ryan's eyes sparkled, ""That's a great idea!""

They began sketching out their outline, including characters, conflicts, and twists. Weeks went by, and with each passing day, their story took shape. They spent countless hours crafting scenes, dialogue, and even designing the treasure map. Finally, after months of hard work, their manuscript was complete.

As they sent their draft to publishers, they wondered what would happen if someone else came along with a similar idea about a treasure hunt. Would they be accused of plagiarism? Emma chuckled, ""Of course not, I came up with the original idea!"" Ryan agreed, ""And our specific story, including the characters and plot twists, is our creative expression.""

Their publishers replied with an offer, citing the unique narrative and characters. Emma and Ryan celebrated, knowing their original idea was protected, while the expression of that idea was theirs alone to own. As they reflected on their journey, Emma smiled, ""The idea of a treasure hunt might be common, but our specific story is what makes it special – and that's what's protected by copyright."""
Ignorantia juris non excusat	"In law, ignorantia juris non excusat (Latin for 'ignorance of the law excuses not'), or ignorantia legis neminem excusat ('ignorance of law excuses no one'), is a legal principle holding that a person who is unaware of a law may not escape liability for violating that law merely by being unaware of its content. 
European-law countries with a tradition of Roman law may also use an expression from Aristotle translated into Latin: nemo censetur ignorare legem ('nobody is thought to be ignorant of the law') or ignorantia iuris nocet ('not knowing the law is harmful')."	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of ""Ignorantia juris non excusat"":

Maya, a young entrepreneur, had just opened a small bakery in a bustling city. She had heard about the local health and safety regulations, but didn't pay much attention to the specific rules regarding food handling and storage. On a busy Saturday morning, a health inspector paid her a visit and discovered several violations: expired cheese in the fridge, improper food handling procedures, and a dirty storage area. Maya was shocked and argued that she didn't know she had to follow those specific rules.

The health inspector patiently explained the regulations to Maya, but she was convinced that she was unaware of them and shouldn't be held accountable. However, the inspector told her that the law expects citizens to take reasonable steps to learn about the rules that apply to their business. Since Maya had access to resources and training programs, her ignorance was not an excuse.

Maya was issued a hefty fine and ordered to take a food safety course. She was also required to make significant changes to her bakery's operations to ensure compliance with the regulations.

Maya was disappointed, but the health inspector explained that not knowing the law doesn't protect her from the consequences of violating it. ""Getting fined is unfortunate,"" she said, ""but ignorance is not an excuse. We expect everyone to do their due diligence and learn about the laws and regulations that impact their lives and business."""
Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois	"Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720 (1977), is a United States Supreme Court case that involved issues concerning statutory standing in antitrust law.
The decision established the rule that indirect purchasers of goods or services along a supply chain cannot seek damages for antitrust violations committed by the original manufacturer or service provider, but it permitted such claims by direct purchasers. Several courts recognize exceptions to the rule.
The decision has become known as the ""Illinois Brick doctrine"" and is applied to determine whether a plaintiff has standing to bring claims under various federal antitrust statutes."	"Here's a story to illustrate the Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois concept:

**The Sandwich Story**

It's a lovely summer day in Chicago, and Sarah goes to her favorite deli to buy a sandwich. She's a huge fan of the deli's freshly baked bread, but the deli, in a bid to cut costs, starts buying their bread from a lower-cost supplier. Unbeknownst to Sarah, the new supplier, LoafBoy Bread, has bribed the original bread manufacturer, Sunny Baked Goods, to raise its prices. This price-fixing agreement between LoafBoy and Sunny Baked Goods is an antitrust violation.

Feeling deceived, the state of Illinois sues both LoafBoy and Sunny Baked Goods on behalf of affected consumers, including Sarah. Sarah stands to gain some damages if the state succeeds in its lawsuit. However, when it comes to court, the judge dismisses Sarah's indirect claim against Sunny Baked Goods, citing the Illinois Brick doctrine.

This is because, even though Sarah was the end-consumer who bought the sandwich, she didn't directly buy from Sunny Baked Goods - she bought it from the deli, LoafBoy Bread. The court rules that indirect purchasers, like Sarah, can't seek damages from the original manufacturer, in this case, Sunny Baked Goods. The deli, LoafBoy Bread, is the only one who can directly sue Sunny Baked Goods, since it was a direct purchaser.

The story illustrates how the Illinois Brick doctrine restricts claims for antitrust violations to direct purchasers, like retailers, of a good or service, excluding indirect consumers like Sarah who buy products from those retailers."
Imminent peril	"Imminent peril, or imminent danger, is an American legal concept that defines the term as ""certain danger, immediate, and impending; menacingly close at hand, and threatening."" In many states in the US, a mere necessity for quick action does not constitute an emergency within the doctrine of imminent peril, where the situation calling for the action is one which should reasonably have been anticipated and which the person whose action is called for should have been prepared to meet; the doctrine of imminent peril does not excuse one who has brought about the peril by their own negligence."	"As the storm surge began to rise, the community of coastal Bayville was evacuated by the mandatory order of the local authorities. Amidst the chaos, Sarah, a resident of Bayville, was asleep when she was suddenly awoken by her phone's alarm, reminding her to pick up her niece from daycare at the other side of town.

Despite the torrential rain and strong winds, Sarah knew she had to make the trip to ensure her niece's safety. In her haste, she didn't notice the fallen tree branch on the road, which blocked the way to her car. Realizing her predicament, she decided to take a side street, which seemed less damaged. Unbeknownst to Sarah, this road was prone to flooding, and as she drove, the floodwaters crept higher and higher, threatening to engulf her vehicle.

In this situation, the doctrine of imminent peril would apply. Sarah's decision to take the side street was a foreseeable mistake, given the storm's severity and the road's history of flooding. Although she acted quickly, her actions were not necessitated by an imminent peril but rather by her own negligence. In fact, had she waited for official instructions or taken a safer route, she may have avoided the risk of her car being swept away.

In this case, the law would likely not excuse Sarah's actions as an emergency response to an imminent peril. Instead, it would consider her actions to be a reckless decision, putting both herself and her niece in harm's way."
Implied license	"An implied license is an unwritten license which permits a party (the licensee) to do something that would normally require the express permission of another party (the licensor). Implied licenses may arise by operation of law from actions by the licensor which lead the licensee to believe that it has the necessary permission.
Implied licenses often arise where the licensee has purchased a physical embodiment of some intellectual property belonging to the licensor, or has paid for its creation, but has not obtained permission to use the intellectual property."	"Meet Sarah, a freelance graphic designer who specializes in creating custom logos for small businesses. One day, she meets Emma, the owner of a charming little bakery, who hires Sarah to design a logo for her new venture. Emma provides Sarah with a general idea of the design she has in mind, and they agree on a rough concept.

Sarah spends several hours working on the logo, incorporating Emma's ideas and adding her own creative touches. When the design is complete, Sarah presents it to Emma, who loves it. Emma says, ""This is perfect – you can use it as our official logo. Just go ahead and print the business cards and website materials."" Sarah doesn't think twice, assuming that Emma has given her permission to use the logo.

Months go by, and Sarah continues to work with Emma, creating marketing materials and branding elements for the bakery. Unbeknownst to Sarah, Emma never signed a formal contract or granted her explicit permission to use the logo. However, Emma has impliedly licensed Sarah to use the logo by allowing her to create the designs and encouraging her to ""go ahead"" with the materials.

One day, another business offers Emma a lucrative deal to use the logo on their packaging. Emma realizes she never formally licensed Sarah to use the logo and starts to get nervous. She consults with a lawyer, who explains to her that an implied license has been created, granting Sarah the right to use the logo. Emma's attorney helps her negotiate a proper license agreement with Sarah, ensuring that Emma retains ownership and control over the logo."
Implied powers	In the United States, implied powers are powers that, although not directly stated in the Constitution, are indirectly given based on expressed powers.	"Meet Emily, a small business owner in a bustling city. She runs a popular bakery, supplying fresh pastries to local cafes and restaurants. One day, Emily wants to expand her business by building a new production facility, but she faces a hurdle - the city zoning laws require a specific permit to operate a commercial bakery in the desired area.

Emily researches the requirements and learns that the city's Planning and Zoning Commission has the express power to issue permits for businesses. However, she soon realizes that the Commission's enabling legislation doesn't explicitly mention a process for issuing permits for bakeries specifically. Emily is stuck.

A clever lawyer suggests that Emily's case relies on implied powers. The lawyer argues that the Commission's expressed power to issue permits for businesses implies the authority to issue permits for bakeries, as a subset of businesses. The lawyer explains that just because the Constitution (or in this case, the city's enabling legislation) doesn't explicitly mention permits for bakeries doesn't mean the power doesn't exist.

Emily's lawyer strategically presents this argument to the Commission, highlighting the reasonable inference that issuing permits for digestible establishments like bakeries falls within the Commission's broader authority over businesses. The Commission agrees, and Emily receives the necessary permit, allowing her to expand her operation. Emily successfully builds her new facility, grateful for the lawyer's creative use of implied powers in her favor.

This scenario illustrates how implied powers can be exercised in real-life scenarios. Even though the Constitution (or enabling legislation) doesn't explicitly mention a specific authority, the connection between expressed powers and the context of the situation can lead to a reasonable inference of implied powers."
Implied repeal	"The doctrine of implied repeal is a concept in constitutional theory which states that where an Act of Parliament or an Act of Congress (or of some other legislature) conflicts with an earlier one, the later Act takes precedence and the conflicting parts of the earlier Act become legally inoperable. This doctrine is expressed in the Latin phrase leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant or ""lex posterior derogat priori"".
Implied repeal is to be contrasted with the express repeal of legislation by the legislative body."	"In the small town of Oakwood, the local council had passed a zoning ordinance in 2010 (the ""Old Ordinance"") regulating the use of land in the downtown area. Among other things, it restricted the construction of new buildings to a maximum height of 30 feet.

Three years later, in 2013, the town council introduced and passed a new comprehensive plan (the ""New Plan"") which aimed to revitalize the downtown area and attract more businesses. As part of this plan, the council increased the maximum building height to 60 feet, while maintaining the existing restrictions on other uses of land.

However, one property owner, John, who had purchased a plot of land in 2012, had already obtained a building permit under the Old Ordinance to construct a 30-foot building. When he went to build, he was surprised to find out that his plans were no longer in compliance with the new zoning regulations.

In this scenario, the New Plan can be seen as an implied repeal of the conflicting parts of the Old Ordinance. Although the Old Ordinance was not specifically repealed, its conflicting provisions (in this case, the 30-foot building height restriction) became inoperative due to the passage of the later and contradictory legislation (the New Plan). John's building permit, issued under the Old Ordinance, would likely be invalidated, as the New Plan took precedence over the earlier regulation. This illustrates the concept of implied repeal, where the later law derogates the earlier one."
Implied terms	"A contractual term is ""any provision forming part of a contract"". Each term gives rise to a contractual obligation, the breach of which may give rise to litigation. Not all terms are stated expressly and some terms carry less legal gravity as they are peripheral to the objectives of the contract.
The terms of a contract are the essence of a contract, and tell the reader what the contract will do. For instance, the price of a good, the time of its promised delivery and the description of the good will all be terms of the contract.
""Terms"" and ""conditions"", although slightly different in their significance, are often treated together in phrases such as ""standard terms and conditions"", or ""Ts and Cs""."	"Here's a short story that illustrates the concept of implied terms:

Susie and Emma decided to start a small home-based bakery business together. They wrote down their agreement on a piece of paper, which included the basics: they would split the profits 50/50, would work together to bake and sell the bread, and would maintain the cleanliness of their shared kitchen space.

However, they didn't write down every single detail. For instance, they didn't specify what would happen if one of them wanted to take a break and go on vacation. Would the other person have to cover all the work? Or would they both need to figure out a way to make it work together?

Months into the business, Emma decided to take a month-long trip to visit her family. She didn't discuss the logistics with Susie and just assumed that Susie would cover all the work during her absence. But Susie felt overwhelmed and frustrated when she realized she had to work extra hours to keep up with the demands of the business.

Feeling torn and upset, Susie asked Emma to reconsider her decision. Emma agreed to pay Susie a fair share of the profits for the month she was away, but only because she knew that Susie had done a significant amount of extra work.

In this situation, the implied term is that both parties would be reasonable and make an effort to work together to find a solution if one of them needed to take a break. This implied term wasn't written down, but it's an unwritten rule that's commonly accepted in most business agreements."
Imputation (law)	"In law, the principle of imputation or attribution underpins the concept that ignorantia juris non excusat—ignorance of the law does not excuse. All laws are published and available for study in all developed states. The said imputation might also be termed ""fair notice"". The content of the law is imputed to all persons who are within the jurisdiction, no matter how transiently.
This fiction tries to negate the unfairness of someone avoiding liability for an act or omission by simply denying knowledge of the law. The principle also arises in specific areas of law, such as criminal law and commercial law, to describe the need for the law to hold a person liable, even when they may not have known the particular circumstances that caused another person to sustain loss or damage."	"As the sun began to set on the bustling streets of downtown Manhattan, Emma, a young artist, had just finished a solo exhibition at a local gallery. She was exhausted but exhilarated by the positive feedback on her work. However, her joy was short-lived, as she received a phone call from the gallery owner, informing her that the exhibition had not met the required minimum attendance to cover the costs. As a result, Emma was liable for a significant portion of the expenses.

Emma was shocked and felt entirely unaware of the consequences. She had never read the contract, assuming the gallery would take care of the logistics. ""But I didn't know!"" she exclaimed. ""This must be a misunderstanding!""

The gallery owner calmly explained the imputation principle to Emma: all laws and contracts are published and available for study, and ignorance of the law does not excuse liability. Emma was forced to confront the fact that, as a professional artist, she should have taken the time to understand the terms of her agreement. The gallery owner had provided her with the contract well in advance, and it was reasonable for her to expect her to be familiar with its contents.

Emma reluctantly accepted responsibility for her share of the expenses, realizing that neglecting her duties as a professional had unintentionally led to financial losses for the gallery. This experience taught her a valuable lesson: it is each individual's responsibility to be aware of the laws and regulations that govern their actions."
In loco parentis	"The term in loco parentis, Latin for ""in the place of a parent"", refers to the legal responsibility of a person or organization to take on some of the functions and responsibilities of a parent.
Originally derived from English common law, the doctrine is applied in two separate areas of the law. First, it grants educational institutions such as colleges and schools discretion to act in the best interests of their students, although not allowing what would be considered violations of the students' civil liberties. Second, this doctrine may allow a non-biological parent to exercise the legal rights and responsibilities of a biological parent if they have held themselves out as the parent.
The in loco parentis doctrine is distinct from the doctrine of parens patriae, the psychological parent doctrine, and adoption."	"As a young single mother, Sarah struggled to balance her work and personal life. Her 17-year-old daughter, Emily, was about to start her freshman year at Oakwood University, a prestigious liberal arts college several hours away. Sarah knew she wouldn't be able to attend Emily's freshman orientation, but she wanted to ensure Emily had a smooth transition to college life.

That's when she turned to Dr. Patel, the director of residence life at Oakwood University. Dr. Patel had been more than just an administrator to Sarah; she had mentored Emily over the summer and kept her informed about Emily's academic and personal progress. Sarah trusted Dr. Patel completely and asked her to keep an eye on Emily and offer guidance when needed.

Dr. Patel happily agreed, and as Emily started college, she made herself available to Emily whenever she needed advice or just someone to talk to. She helped Emily navigate class schedules, residences, and campus social life. Dr. Patel even attended parent-teacher conferences, ensuring Emily's academic performance was on track.

Over the next few semesters, Dr. Patel became a vital presence in Emily's life, acting in loco parentis. She took on the responsibilities of a parent, providing care, guidance, and support to Emily whenever needed. When Emily got into trouble with a new friend, Dr. Patel mediated the situation and offered words of wisdom. Sarah was grateful to have someone she trusted watching over Emily, and Emily flourished under Dr. Patel's care.

This scenario illustrates the principle of in loco parentis, where a person or organization (Dr. Patel) exercises the authority and responsibilities of a parent in a child's life, albeit not biologically related. In this case, Dr. Patel's actions were guided by a deep understanding of Emily's needs and concerns, as well as her professional expertise in residence life."
In pari delicto	"In pari delicto (potior/melior est conditio possidentis), Latin for ""in equal fault (better is the condition of the possessor)"", is a legal term used to refer to two persons or entities who are equally at fault, whether the malfeasance in question is a crime or tort. The doctrine is subject to a number of exceptions, including that the plaintiff must be an active, voluntary participant in the wrongful conduct, the plaintiff's wrongdoing must be at least substantially equal to or greater than that of the defendant, the ""adverse interest"" exception, and the ""innocent insider"" exception."	"Alex and Maddie were two college friends who got into a bar fight after a wild night out. The two had been drinking excessively and had been throwing back shots of tequila for hours. The argument started over a girl, escalating into a heated dispute that ended with both of them punching each other, resulting in a messy brawl.

The next day, Alex was sued for damages for bodily harm to Maddie. Initially, Alex claimed to have been the victim, pointing fingers at Maddie as the aggressor. 

The court, however, decided to apply the in pari delicto doctrine, recognizing that both Alex and Maddie were equally responsible for the fight. Both had been involved in excessive drinking, had instigated the argument, and had punched each other. This finding made the court declare that both parties were equally at fault and therefore neither could recover damages.

The decision made headlines locally, sparking debate about responsibility in extreme situations."
Incorporation of international law	"The incorporation of international law is the process by which international agreements become part of the municipal law of a sovereign state. A country incorporates a treaty by passing domestic legislation that gives effect to the treaty in the national legal system.
Whether incorporation is necessary depends on a country's domestic law. Some states follow a monist system where treaties can become law without incorporation, if their provisions are considered sufficiently self-explanatory. In contrast dualist states require all treaties to be incorporated before they can have any domestic legal effects. Most countries follow a treaty ratification method somewhere between these two extremes."	"Meet Sophia, a young traveler who has just returned from a trip to Japan. Sophia is thrilled to have visited Japan, but she's also a bit confused about something. During her trip, she noticed that many restaurants and shops proudly displayed a logo and text in Japanese that read ""Convention on International Trade"" or ""Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations."" Essentially, Sophia had unknowingly been surrounded by international law.

When I asked Sophia about her concern, she mentioned that her friend's business partner, a Japanese citizen, had recently been stopped at customs for carrying a large quantity of goods. The customs officer cited the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which regulates diplomatic immunity. However, this convention was not mentioned in Japan's domestic laws.

To clarify the situation, Sophia approached me, a lawyer, for advice. I explained that Japan is a dualist state that requires treaties to be incorporated into domestic law before they take effect. In this case, the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations was ratified by Japan in 1972, but it has not been incorporated into Japanese law. This means that the convention is not directly applicable in Japan and its provisions cannot be cited in domestic courts.

To resolve her friend's issue, we needed to find a way to apply the provisions of the Vienna Convention to the Japanese legal system. With the help of a local lawyer, we drafted a domestic law that incorporated the relevant provisions of the Vienna Convention. Now, businesses and individuals in Japan are protected under international law, just like Sophia's friend. This is an example of the incorporation of international law, allowing countries to apply international agreements within their domestic legal systems."
Independent source doctrine	"In US law, the independent source doctrine is an exception to the exclusionary rule. The doctrine applies to evidence initially discovered during, or as a consequence of, an unlawful search, but later obtained independently from activities untainted by the initial illegality.

The United States Supreme Court, in Nix v. Williams, provided the policy rationale for admitting tainted evidence:  The independent source doctrine teaches us that the interest of society in deterring unlawful conduct and the public interest in having juries receive all probative evidence of a crime are properly balanced by putting the police in the same, not a worse, position that they would have been in if no police error or misconduct had occurred.
The United States Supreme Court, in Murray v. United States provided the current independent source doctrine rule. The Murray court held that a state may not rely on the independent source doctrine if (1) the agents' decision to seek the warrant was prompted by what they had seen during the initial entry or (2) if information obtained during that entry was presented to the Magistrate and affected his decision to issue the warrant."	"Here's a short story that illustrates the Independent Source Doctrine:

Pam Thompson was a suspect in a string of jewelry store robberies in a small town. Officer Jenkins had been investigating the case for weeks, but had yet to find evidence linking Pam to the crimes. One night, Jenkins decided to conduct a midnight search of Pam's apartment without a warrant, hoping to find something incriminating.

Although Jenkins didn't find any evidence during the initial search, she did notice a suspicious-looking safe in Pam's bedroom. Jenkins decided to leave the search and come back with a warrant. When she returned with the warrant, she searched the safe and found a stash of stolen jewelry.

In court, the prosecution introduced the evidence from the safe as part of their case against Pam. Defense attorney, James, moved to suppress the evidence, arguing that it was obtained as a direct result of the unlawful search and was therefore tainted. However, the judge ruled that the independent source doctrine applied, as the search of the safe was conducted with a valid warrant and separate from the initial unlawful search.

As explained by James, ""Even though Officer Jenkins may have gotten lucky and decided to obtain a warrant after the initial search, the evidence found in the safe would have been obtained regardless of the initial illegality. The real question is whether the evidence was obtained lawfully, and in this case, it was.""

The jury convicted Pam, and James appealed, arguing that the evidence should have been suppressed. The higher court upheld the conviction, citing the independent source doctrine and concluding that society's interest in deterring crime and having juries receive all relevant evidence outweighed the possibility of police misconduct."
Index of children's rights articles	Articles related to children's rights include:	"Here's a story that illustrates the Index of Children's Rights Articles:

---

It's a typical Tuesday morning at the local children's hospital when 8-year-old Maria arrives with her mother, Maria Sr. The doctors inform them that Maria has developed a serious condition that requires immediate surgery. Maria's mother is worried sick, but the hospital's social worker, Ms. Rodriguez, notices that Maria seems particularly upset.

Ms. Rodriguez shares with Maria Sr. that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which her hospital follows, emphasizes the importance of respecting children's rights, especially in situations like Maria's. She explains that this means ensuring Maria's safety, dignity, and well-being.

Ms. Rodriguez proceeds to involve Maria in the decision-making process, explaining the surgery in a way that Maria can understand, and asking her what she would like to do. Maria, feeling more in control, decides she wants to hold her mother's hand during the procedure.

This decision is in line with Article 12 of the Convention, which guarantees all children the right to express their views and have them taken into account in all matters affecting them. As the surgery begins, Maria Sr. holds her hand, comforting her daughter, while the medical team also respects Maria's right to special care and attention (Article 20).

Thanks to the hospital's commitment to the Index of Children's Rights Articles, Maria's experience is less traumatic, and she and her mother can focus on her recovery together.

---

This story aims to illustrate the legal concept of the Index of Children's Rights Articles by depicting a relatable scenario where healthcare providers prioritize a child's rights, specifically:

* Article 12: Respect for the child's views and participation in decision-making
* Article 20: The right to special care and attention

By showing the positive impact of these articles in a concrete situation, I hope this story helps non-experts understand how these rights contribute to ensuring the well-being of children like Maria."
Inequality of bargaining power	"Inequality of bargaining power in law, economics and social sciences refers to a situation where one party to a bargain, contract or agreement, has more and better alternatives than the other party. This results in one party having greater power than the other to choose not to take the deal and makes it more likely that this party will gain more favourable terms and grant them more negotiating power (as they are in a better position to reject the deal). Inequality of bargaining power is generally thought to undermine the freedom of contract, resulting in a disproportionate level of freedom between parties, and it represents a place at which markets fail.
Where bargaining power is persistently unequal, the concept of inequality of bargaining power serves as a justification for the implication of mandatory terms into contracts by law, or the non-enforcement of a contract by the courts."	"Meet Emma, a small business owner who has been struggling to stay afloat in the retail industry. She relies on a single wholesaler, Joe, for most of her inventory. Joe, however, owns a large chain of stores and has multiple suppliers vying for his attention.

One day, Emma discovers that Joe plans to increase the wholesale price of his products by 20%. In desperation, she agrees to the new terms, thinking that she has no other choice. Meanwhile, Joe's company can easily absorb the increased costs, and he doesn't lose much sleep over the deal.

In this situation, Joe has more and better alternatives than Emma. He can easily find another customer to replace her, while Emma would likely suffer significant losses if she were to break the contract and switch to a new supplier. This disparity in bargaining power gives Joe an upper hand, allowing him to dictate the terms of the agreement.

As a result, the contract is one-sided, with Emma bearing the brunt of the increased costs. This is a prime example of inequality of bargaining power, where Joe's superior negotiating position allows him to gain favorable terms at Emma's expense. In such situations, the law may intervene to protect the weaker party, such as by imposing ceilings on prices or mandating more balanced contract terms."
Inevitable disclosure	"Inevitable disclosure is a legal doctrine through which an employer can claim trade secret to enjoin a former employee from working in a job that may result in the use of trade secrets without the need for proof or evidence.  
The inevitable-disclosure doctrine is one's means in demonstrating a revelation of trade secrets, and some have recently found some renewed judicial support. Where it is acceptable, the doctrine allows the court to find that a former employee would disclose proprietary information in their position with a new employer, even if there is no evidence of actual disclosure. Thus, allowing a company to make a critical showing, when it can't do so if required to come forward with evidence of misconduct. However, because it also rests on a prediction about a future harm, inevitable disclosure also is in tension with the general principle that injunctive relief will not be given to prevent a conjectural injury at any means."	"As a lead developer at TechCorp, Rachel had spent years creating advanced algorithms for facial recognition software. Her work was highly valued by the company, and she was considered one of the top experts in her field.

When TechCorp announced its decision to downsize, Rachel found herself out of a job. She had been approached by a competitor, NovaTech, offering her a role as chief architect of their AI research department. The company was eager to capitalize on Rachel's expertise and her experience in developing cutting-edge facial recognition software.

As Rachel considered the offer, she began to think about the potential risks of joining NovaTech. She knew that her work at TechCorp was heavily guarded by non-disclosure agreements and trade secrets. NovaTech was a direct competitor, and she worried that her involvement could lead to the disclosure of TechCorp's proprietary information.

The day before her start date at NovaTech, Rachel and her former employer, TechCorp, came to a compromise. Recognizing the potential for inevitable disclosure, TechCorp sought a court injunction, preventing Rachel from working at NovaTech and accessing sensitive information. The court granted the injunction, citing the doctrine of inevitable disclosure. The judge ruled that, given Rachel's position and the nature of her work, it was highly likely that she would inevitably disclose TechCorp's trade secrets to NovaTech, causing irreparable harm to the company.

This scenario illustrates the legal concept of inevitable disclosure, where an employer can prohibit an ex-employee from working in a role that may lead to the use of trade secrets, even in the absence of evidence of actual misappropriation."
Inevitable discovery	"Inevitable discovery is a doctrine in United States criminal procedure that permits admission of evidence that was obtained through illegal means if it would ""inevitably"" have been obtained regardless of the illegality. It is one of several exceptions to the exclusionary rule, or the related fruit-of-the-poisonous tree doctrine, which prevent evidence collected in violation of a defendant's constitutional rights from being admitted in court."	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of ""inevitable discovery"":

Samantha, a detective with the local police department, was investigating a string of convenience store robberies in the small town of Oakdale. One night, she obtained a search warrant for the suspect's home, but it was after business hours, so she decided to ""check it out"" first to see if she could gather any evidence. She spotted a suspicious package in the backyard and, without a warrant, opened it to find stolen cash and merchandise. The package was later confirmed to be from one of the robbed convenience stores.

Later, the judge granted a warrant to search the house, and detectives found more evidence linking the suspect to the crimes. The prosecution planned to use the stolen goods as key evidence at trial.

In court, the prosecutor argued that the package would have been inevitably discovered during the authorized search of the house with a warrant. The judge agreed, ruling that the evidence could be admitted, citing the doctrine of inevitable discovery. Samantha would have been unable to hide the discovery of the package, and it would have been found during the authorized search, even if she hadn't sniffed around beforehand.

This scenario illustrates the concept of inevitable discovery, where an illegal act (in this case, Samantha's unauthorized search) does not prejudice the defendant, because the evidence would have ultimately been discovered through legal means."
Inherent jurisdiction	"Inherent jurisdiction is a doctrine of the English common law that a superior court has the jurisdiction to hear any matter that comes before it, unless a statute or rule limits that authority or grants exclusive jurisdiction to some other court or tribunal. The term is also used when a governmental institution derives its jurisdiction from a fundamental governing instrument such as a constitution. In the English case of Bremer Vulkan Schiffbau und Maschinenfabrik v. South India Shipping Corporation Ltd, Lord Diplock described the court's inherent jurisdiction as a general power to control its own procedure so as to prevent its being used to achieve injustice. 
Inherent jurisdiction appears to apply to an almost limitless set of circumstances. There are four general categories for use of the court's inherent jurisdiction:

to ensure convenience and fairness in legal proceedings;
to prevent steps being taken that would render judicial proceedings inefficacious;
to prevent abuses of process;
to act in aid of superior courts and in aid or control of inferior courts and tribunals.
As such, the exercise of inherent jurisdiction is a broad doctrine allowing a court to control its own processes and to control the procedures before it. The power stems not from any particular statute or legislation, but rather from inherent powers invested in a court to control the proceedings brought before it."	"Imagine a family court case involving a father, John, who has been denied custodial rights to his two children despite being a fit and loving parent. The mother, Sarah, has a history of substance abuse and has been neglecting the children's well-being. The children's maternal grandparents, however, have been actively involved in their lives and have expressed a strong desire to take on a more significant caregiving role.

During the proceedings, Sarah's lawyers repeatedly delay the trial, claiming that they need more time to review documents. Meanwhile, the grandparents become increasingly frustrated, as they believe that the delay is unfairly impacting the children's well-being.

The family court judge, in exercise of his inherent jurisdiction, decides to take control of the proceedings. He schedules an emergency hearing to consider the grandparents' petition to seek interim custody of the children, dismissing Sarah's lawyers' delaying tactics.

The judge explains that the court's role is not only to ensure justice but also to prevent injustice and ensure the welfare of the children. By allowing the grandparents to care for the children on an interim basis, the court can ensure their immediate safety and well-being, while also giving the mother the opportunity to address her addiction issues.

In this scenario, the judge exercises his inherent jurisdiction to control the proceedings and to act in the best interests of the children. The doctrine allows the court to take extraordinary measures to prevent injustice, ensure fairness, and safeguard the welfare of those under its jurisdiction. In this case, the judge used his inherent jurisdiction to facilitate a more expedient and equitable resolution to the proceedings, ensuring a better outcome for the children involved."
Inherent powers (United States)	In United States law, inherent powers are the powers that a state officer or entity purports to hold under a general vesting of authority, even though they are neither enumerated nor implied.	"As the Governor of California, Rachel stood at the podium, prepared to address the rapidly spreading wildfire engulfing the state. With the flames mere miles from the city, she knew every minute counted. While she had no specific powers granted by the legislature to handle this crisis, she was determined to take action.

Rachel recalled the oath she swore to uphold the constitution, protect the people, and preserve the state's sovereignty. She believed that, as the chief executive, it was her duty to respond to this emergency, even if it wasn't explicitly stated in her constitutional powers. With this understanding, she ordered the National Guard to deploy, mobilized emergency responders, and coordinated with federal agencies to allocate resources.

As the situation unfolded, critics argued that Rachel overstepped her bounds, citing the need for legislative approval before taking such drastic measures. Defenders, however, pointed out that the Governor was exercising inherent powers – the abilities she possessed as a result of her office, regardless of specific authorization.

In the end, the Governor's controversial decisions paid off, as the wildfire was finally contained. jednak, the legal debate surrounding her actions continued. Did Rachel's reliance on inherent powers constitute an abuse of authority, or was it a necessary response to the crisis? This story highlights the blurred lines between delegation of authority and inherent powers, demonstrating the ongoing importance of a balance between the Governor's executive authority and the legislative oversight essential to effective governance."
Internal affairs doctrine	"The internal affairs doctrine is a choice of law rule in corporate law.  Simply stated, it provides that the ""internal affairs"" of a corporation (e.g. conflicts between shareholders and management figures such as the board of directors and corporate officers) will be governed by the corporate statutes and case law of the state in which the corporation is incorporated, sometimes referred to as the lex incorporationis."	"Meet Jane, a passionate shareholder of TechCorp, a fast-growing software company incorporated in Delaware. She's been a loyal supporter of the company since its early days, attending annual meetings and advocating for innovative products. However, things took a turn when the company's CEO, Mark, and the board of directors made a surprise merger announcement without consulting shareholders.

Jane was frustrated and felt the merger diluted her stake in the company. She decided to sue Mark, the board, and the corporation, claiming breach of fiduciary duty and seeking damages. But as the case progressed, Jane's lawyers realized they were facing an unexpected hurdle: Delaware law governed internal corporate matters, including the suit against Mark and the board.

This meant that, regardless of where the alleged wrongdoing took place, Delaware's corporate statutes and case law would guide the court's decisions. Jane's team had to adapt to these unfamiliar laws, which simplified and streamlined corporate governance matters, limiting the scope of shareholder actions.

In the end, despite Jane's strong case, the Delaware court dismissed her claims, citing the corporate statutes' restrictions on shareholder suits. Jane was disappointed but understood the importance of Delaware's ""internal affairs"" doctrine, which prioritized the stability and predictability of corporate governance. She acknowledged that TechCorp's successful growth was a direct result of Delaware's pro-business environment, and that her sacrifice was a small price to pay for being part of the company's remarkable journey.

In this relatable scenario, the internal affairs doctrine highlights the importance of Delaware law in governing corporate internal matters, ensuring stability and predictability in the face of dispute."
Invitation to treat	"An invitation to treat (or invitation to bargain in the United States) is a concept within contract law which comes from the Latin phrase invitatio ad offerendum, meaning ""inviting an offer"". According to Professor Andrew Burrows, an invitation to treat is

an expression of willingness to negotiate. A person making an invitation to treat does not intend to be bound as soon as it is accepted by the person to whom the statement is addressed.
Sometimes a person may not offer to sell  their goods, but makes some statement or gives some information with a view to inviting others to make offers on the basis. Likewise, inviting persons to an auction, where goods to be auctioned are displayed, is not an offer for the sale of goods. The offer is made by the intending buyers in the form of bid. Such an offer (bid), when accepted by the fall of hammer or in some other customary way, will result in a (binding) contract. A contract is a legally binding voluntary agreement formed when one person makes an offer, and the other accepts it. There may be some preliminary discussion before an offer is formally made. Such pre-contractual representations may include ""invitations to treat"", ""requests for information"" or ""statements of intention"".
True offers may be accepted to form a contract, whereas representations such as invitations to treat may not. However, although an invitation to treat cannot be accepted it should not be ignored, for it may nevertheless affect the offer. For example, where an offer is made in response to an invitation to treat, the offer may incorporate the terms of the invitation to treat (unless the offer expressly incorporates different terms). If, as in the Boots case (described below) the offer is made by an action without any negotiations—such as presenting goods to a cashier—the offer will be presumed to be on the terms of the invitation to treat."	"Meet Sarah, a used book enthusiast, who frequently visits a local bookstore, ""Page Turners"". Sarah has been eyeing a rare edition of her favorite author's book, ""The Lost City"", for a while. One day, while browsing, she strikes up a conversation with the owner, Michael, about the book. Michael mentions that he's considering selling it and might be willing to part with it for a good price.

Michael says, ""I'm open to offering it to the right buyer, let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the price."" Sarah is thrilled and decides to make an offer. She says, ""I'm interested, what price range are you thinking?""

At this point, Michael hasn't made an explicit offer, but he's willing to engage in a negotiation. He responds, ""I'd like to hear some numbers, what do you think it's worth?"" This is an example of an invitation to treat, an expression of willingness to negotiate to form a contractual agreement.

Sarah makes an offer, and Michael accepts. They agree on a price, and the deal is done. Michael could have said, ""I'll sell it to you for $X"", but instead, he made an invitation to treat, which allowed them to negotiate and form a contract.

In this scenario, Michael's initial statement (I'm open to offering it to the right buyer, let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the price) is an invitation to treat, an expression of willingness to negotiate. It's not an offer itself, but rather an opportunity for Sarah to make an offer in response. His subsequent statements, such as ""I'd like to hear some numbers, what do you think it's worth?"", are the actual offer, which Sarah accepts."
Judicial deference	Judicial deference is the condition of a court yielding or submitting its judgment to that of another legitimate party, such as the executive branch in the case of national defense. It is most commonly found in countries, such as the United Kingdom, which lack an entrenched constitution, as the essential purpose of such documents is to limit the power of the legislature.	"In the country of Everia, where the constitution is a compact, not an entrenched document, the Premier, the head of the government, has declared that it is necessary, in times of economic crisis, to divert funds intended for the national parks system to bolster the ailing nation's economy.

Rachel, an environmental activist, files a lawsuit challenging the Premier's decision, arguing that it constitutes an unconstitutional overreach of executive authority and worsening the ecological damage to the parks. During the trIn the bustling city of London, Oxford University's Professor of Law, Dr. Thompson, was known for her expertise in security policies at airports. The British government had recently introduced a new law requiring every domestic passenger to undergo thorough screening before boarding a flight, including a sharp-eyed examination of their personal electronics.

A group of students from Dr. Thompson's class, planning to attend a study abroad program in the US, were concerned that this new measure would deter students from traveling. The townspeople felt that it intruded on their moment of solitude and was an overstep by the government.

Dr. Thompson was approached by the students to represent them in court. As the case progressed, it was clear that the Ministry of Defense endorsed the law, citing the pressing need for enhanced aviation security in response to international threats. Their expert testimony proved solid, implicating likely group terrorism on several foreign airlines originating and transiting through the United Kingdom.

During closing arguments, the judge announced he agreed with the government's assessment and gave the executive branch the deference, dismissing the students' lawsuit on the basis that it fell within the executive branch's purview of internal security matters. Dr. Thompson realized the greatly specific, relaxed detracting burden standards the state actually had beforehand.

This legal decision prevented a national law impairment that conclusively showed judicial deference could safeguard efficiently by looping continually in value compliance."
Judicial discretion	"Judicial discretion is the power of the judiciary to make some legal decisions according to their discretion. Under the doctrine of the separation of powers, the ability of judges to exercise discretion is an aspect of judicial independence. Where appropriate, judicial discretion allows  a judge to decide a legal case or matter within a range of possible decisions.
However, where the exercise of discretion goes beyond constraints set down by legislation, by binding precedent, or by a constitution, the court may be abusing its discretion and undermining the rule of law.  In that case, the decision of the court may be ultra vires, and may sometimes be characterized as judicial activism.
In 1824, US Chief Justice John Marshall wrote the following on this subject:

Judicial power, as contradistinguished from the power of the laws, has no existence. Courts are the mere instruments of the law, and can will nothing. When they are said to exercise a discretion, it is a mere legal discretion, a discretion to be exercised in discerning the course prescribed by law; and, when that is discerned, it is the duty of the court to follow it. Judicial power is never exercised for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the judge, always for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the legislature; or, in other words, to the will of the law.
Concerns with regard to recidivism and other law and order issues have led to the introduction of mandatory sentencing. E.g. three-strikes laws and most sex offender registry laws in US are examples of laws carrying severe consequences, and which does not leave room for sentencing judges to consider the actual gravity of the offense, thus significantly limiting judicial discretion in sentencing. Introduction of mandatory minimum in criminal sentencing is often viewed as a shift of judicial power from judges to prosecutors, who are capable of affecting the length of potential sentence through their charging decision, e.g. filing charges on lesser included offense and dropping the charges carrying mandatory minimum sentences. Mandatory sentencing laws have been particularly popular among legislators in the United States. This has provoked formation of non-profit organizations such as Families Against Mandatory Minimums, Women Against Registry and RSOL to lobby for reinstatement of judicial discretion in criminal sentencing."	"Emily, a 25-year-old freelance writer, was arrested for shoplifting a pair of shoes from a local department store. Although she had no prior offenses, the store security guard caught her in the act and called the police. Emily's defense attorney, Rachel, argued that Emily's actions were a one-time mistake and that she had shown remorse for her actions.

At the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor insisted on a minimum 30-day sentence as prescribed by the state's mandatory sentencing law, which handed down severe penalties for first-time offenders who commit certain crimes. Rachel urged the judge to show mercy and exercise his discretion, taking into account Emily's lack of prior offenses and her apologies. She argued that a 30-day sentence would be a disproportionate punishment for Emily's minor offense.

The judge, Judge Harris, listened carefully to both the prosecutor and Rachel's arguments. After careful consideration, he decided to sentence Emily to a 15-day sentence, noting that the state's mandatory sentencing law did not take into account the individual circumstances of the case. He believed that a less severe sentence would allow Emily to take responsibility for her actions without perpetuating a cycle of recidivism.

In this scenario, Judge Harris exercised his judicial discretion, balancing the state's strict sentencing law with the complexity of Emily's case. By not blindly following the mandatory minimum sentence, Judge Harris demonstrated the importance of a judge's discretion in bringing justice and fairness to each individual case."
Jurisprudence constante	"Jurisprudence constante (French for ""stable jurisprudence"", or literally, ""constant jurisprudence"") is a legal doctrine according to which a long series of previous decisions applying a particular legal principle or rule is highly persuasive but not controlling in subsequent cases dealing with similar or identical issues of law.  This doctrine is recognized in most civil law jurisdictions as well as in certain mixed jurisdictions, e.g., Louisiana.
The rule of law applied in the jurisprudence constante directly compares with stare decisis. But the Louisiana Supreme Court notes the principal difference between the two legal doctrines: a single court decision can provide sufficient foundation for stare decisis; however, ""a
series of adjudicated cases, all in accord, form the basis for jurisprudence constante."" Moreover, the Louisiana Court of Appeal has explicitly noted that within Louisiana, jurisprudence constante is merely a secondary source of law, which cannot be authoritative and does not rise to the level of the source of law, which is legislation. Judicial decisions are not intended to be an authoritative source of law, and, thus, the civilian tradition does not recognize the doctrine of stare decisis."	"In the small town of Bayou Blue, a long-standing local tradition allowed residents to fish in the bayou as long as they respected the water's nuances. The town's court had never directly addressed the issue, but over the years, judges had consistently ruled in favor of individuals who were found to have genuinely respected the bayou's rhythms.

In 1950, Judge Thompson ruled that a group of anglers who had carefully released their catch to ensure the bayou's population remained healthy had a legitimate right to fish. Eleven years later, Judge Moreno dismissed a lawsuit brought by a neighboring town, arguing that the Bayou Blue's fishing tradition was not harming the environment. In the 1980s, Judge Dupré confirmed that the town's unique fishing practices were in harmony with the bayou's natural balance.

Fast-forward to 2010, when a group of eco-activists challenged the town's fishing tradition, citing concerns about fish depletion and environmental damage. The court, now composed of Judges Lafleur, LeBlanc, and Jackson, was faced with a similar issue. While there was no specific precedent in the form of a single binding case, the judges considered the consistent series of previous decisions supporting the town's fishing tradition. Drawing from this jurisprudence constante, they ruled that the tradition was not only permissible but also an essential part of Bayou Blue's identity.

In this scenario, the court didn't simply apply a single previous decision (stare decisis), but rather drew from a consistent pattern of decisions that reflected the town's unique relationship with the bayou. This jurisprudence constante informed the judges' decision, demonstrating how a long-standing series of rulings can influence subsequent outcomes in similar cases."
Ker–Frisbie doctrine	The Ker–Frisbie doctrine is applied in the context of jurisdiction and generally holds that courts have jurisdiction over criminal defendants in the United States regardless of whether their presence before the court is lawfully secured.	"Meet Emily, a 25-year-old international student visiting the United States on a valid student visa. During her study abroad program, Emily gets into a dispute with her roommate over a shared apartment in New York City. The roommate accuses Emily of theft and calls the police. While Emily is waiting for the police to arrive, the roommate's friends arrive and abduct Emily, allegedly at the insistence of the roommate.

The group drives Emily to Chicago and throws her off a cruise ship at the docks, saying ""You're not our problem anymore."" Unbeknownst to Emily, the ship was about to depart for Europe. Exhausted and disoriented, Emily makes her way to the local police station, where she reports the incident.

The Chicago police department launches an investigation and recovers evidence linking Emily's roommate and associates to the abduction. They charge Emily's abductors with federal crimes and petition for custody of Emily under the Federal Kidnapping Act. Emily's abductors argue that the court has no jurisdiction over them since Emily was brought to Chicago involuntarily.

However, the court upholds the constitutionality of the Ker-Frisbie doctrine and exercises jurisdiction over the defendants, citing that Emily was brought to the court's jurisdiction, even if it was through involuntary means. The court's jurisdiction is not dependent on the legal or lawful manner in which Emily was brought to Chicago, but rather on the fact that she is currently within the territorial boundaries of the court. The defendants are subsequently tried and convicted for their crimes.

This scenario illustrates the Ker-Frisbie doctrine, where the court exercises jurisdiction over criminal defendants, regardless of how they arrived in the jurisdiction, as long as they are present before the court."
Knock and talk	In law enforcement, a knock and talk is an investigative technique where one or more police officers approaches a private residence, knocks on the door, and requests consent from the owner to search the residence. This strategy is often utilised when criminal activity is suspected, but there is not sufficient evidence to obtain a search warrant.	"Here's a short story that illustrates the legal concept of ""Knock and Talk"":

It's a typical Monday morning in suburban Anytown, USA. Detective James is investigating a string of package thefts in the area. After reviewing security footage, he has reason to believe that the stolen packages are being received at a particular residence on Elm Street. Without sufficient evidence to obtain a search warrant, James decides to conduct a ""knock and talk"" at the residence.

He arrives at the home, knocks on the door, and introduces himself to Mrs. Johnson, who answers. James explains that he's investigating a series of package thefts in the area and asks if he can come in to ask a few questions. Mrs. Johnson, initially hesitant, agrees to let him in.

 Inside, James shows her photos of the stolen packages and asks if she's seen anything suspicious. Mrs. Johnson denies any involvement, but James notices a suspicious package behind her on the counter. He asks if he can take a closer look, and Mrs. Johnson reluctantly lets him.

After examining the package, James finds evidence linking it to the stolen goods. She eventually confesses to her involvement in the thefts. Without the ""knock and talk"" technique, James may not have gotten the evidence he needed to crack the case."
Laches (equity)	"In common-law legal systems, laches ( LAT-chiz, ;  Law French: remissness, dilatoriness, from Old French: laschesse) is a lack of diligence and activity in making a legal claim, or moving forward with legal enforcement of a right, particularly in regard to  equity. It is an unreasonable delay that can be viewed as prejudicing the opposing party. When asserted in litigation, it is an equity defense, that is, a defense to a claim for an equitable remedy.  It is often understood in comparison to a statute of limitations, a statutory defense, which traditionally is a defense to a claim ""at law"".
The person invoking laches is asserting that an opposing party has ""slept on its rights"", and that, as a result of this delay, circumstances have changed (witnesses or evidence may have been lost or no longer available, etc.), such that it is no longer a just resolution to grant the plaintiff's claim. Laches is associated with the maxim of equity: ""Equity aids the vigilant"" – not those who sleep on their rights. Put another way, failure to assert one's rights in a timely manner can result in a claim being barred by laches."	"The sun had long since set on Sunnybrook Farm, once a thriving dairy operation. Thomas, a young boy who had once been a close friend and business partner of the farm's owner, John, had never forgotten the memories they shared on the farm. After John's passing, Thomas had mistakenly assumed that the farm would be divided equally among John's children, including his own daughter, Emily.

Years passed, and Thomas never took any formal action to confirm the division of the farm or formalize his rights to a share. Emily, meanwhile, grew up and eventually took over the farm, modernizing it and expanding its operations. As Thomas entered his golden years, he finally realized his mistake and sought to claim his share of the farm.

However, by the time Thomas filed his claim, nearly two decades had passed since John's passing. Emily had invested heavily in the farm, and many of the original records and witnesses had long since been lost or retired. The court ultimately ruled in favor of Emily, citing laches as the reason. Thomas's delay in asserting his rights had prejudiced Emily, making it unfair to interrupt her successful management of the farm at this late stage.

The judge's decision echoed the maxim of equity: ""Equity aids the vigilant, not those who sleep on their rights."" Thomas's long inaction had allowed circumstances to change, making it just that his claim be denied. Emily, more vigilant in her pursuit of her rights, had the farm to show for it."
Last clear chance	"The last clear chance doctrine of tort law is applicable to negligence cases in jurisdictions that apply rules of contributory negligence in lieu of comparative negligence. Under this doctrine, a negligent plaintiff can nonetheless recover if he is able to show that the defendant had the last opportunity to avoid the accident. Though the stated rationale has differed depending on the jurisdiction adopting the doctrine, the underlying idea is to mitigate the harshness of the contributory negligence rule. Conversely, a defendant can also use this doctrine as a defense.  If the plaintiff has the last clear chance to avoid the accident, the defendant will not be liable.
The introduction of the doctrine is widely attributed to the English case of Davies v. Mann, 152 Eng. Rep. 588 (1842)."	"Maria was driving home from a late-night shift at work, fatigued from exhaustion. She drifted across the center line and collided with Tom's vehicle. Maria's car sustained significant damage, and she claimed damages.

At trial, the court discovered Maria had a history of falling asleep at the wheel. When it was her turn to speak, Maria confessed she had known about her increased risk of falling asleep while driving due to her late-night shifts but didn't change her behavior. On the night of the accident, the dash cam footage revealed Maria was unconscious for about three seconds before the collision. There was no indication she tried to regain control of the car.

Tom's lawyer argued that Maria acted negligently by driving after her history of falling asleep and failed to take steps to mitigate that risk. He also stated that once she became aware she had dozed off, she should have taken action – pull over or wake herself up.

Maria's lawyer countered that though Maria was negligent for being on the road with a history of falling asleep, Tom had a clear opportunity to stop or slow down. There was no hazardous road condition or sudden weather change that would explain Tom's failure to notice Maria's drifting or react. The court ultimately found that since Maria had dozed off after a string of events that were known to her (her late-night shift history and unintended lapse into unconsciousness), Tom did have the last clear chance to avoid the accident. The court decided that Tom should be the one to pick up the tab for the damages, rather than Maria."
Last injurious exposure rule	In law, the last injurious exposure rule is the principle that when an occupational disease was caused by a succession of jobs, or could have been caused by any one of a succession of jobs, the most recent employer with the risk exposure is liable.	"Meet Sarah, a 40-year-old nurse who's been working in the medical field for over 20 years. Throughout her career, Sarah has worked for several different hospitals, each with varying levels of asbestos exposure. As a nurse, she spent a significant amount of time in dusty areas, such as the hospital's isolation ward, and was often exposed to old pipe insulation and floor tile.

After years of exposure to asbestos, Sarah developed severe mesothelioma, a deadly lung cancer. She sued several of her former employers, alleging that their failure to provide proper safety equipment and training led to her exposure.

The judge ruled in Sarah's favor, but only against her most recent employer, Medical Center South. Although all of Sarah's employers could have potentially contributed to her exposure, the court applied the last injurious exposure rule. Since Medical Center South was Sarah's most recent employer, with the longest and most recent exposure to asbestos, they were deemed responsible for her injuries.

Sarah's previous employers, although also having exposed her to asbestos, were no longer liable because they had long since removed the asbestos and implemented safer working conditions. The court determined that if any one of Sarah's employers had been entirely responsible for her exposure, it would have been Medical Center South. Therefore, they alone were legally responsible for Sarah's devastating injury.

The last injurious exposure rule prioritizes accountability and fairness by holding the most recent employer with a significant risk exposure liable for the harm caused. In Sarah's case, the rule ensured that the employer with the most recent opportunity to provide a safer work environment was held accountable for her mesothelioma diagnosis."
Law of the case	"The law of the case is a legal term of art that is applicable mainly in common law, or Anglo-American, jurisdictions that recognize the related doctrine of stare decisis.  The phrase refers to instances where ""rulings made by a trial court and not challenged on appeal become the law of the case."" ""Unless the trial court's rulings were clearly in error or there has been an important change in circumstances, the court's prior rulings must stand."" Usually the situation occurs when either a case is on appeal for the second time—e.g. if the reviewing court remanded the matter to the trial court and the party appeals again or if the case was appealed in a higher appellate court—for example, from an appellate court to the highest court.
As generally used, ""law of the case"" states that, if an appellate court has passed on a legal question and remanded the case to the court below for further proceedings, the legal question thus determined by the appellate court will not be differently determined on a subsequent appeal in the same case where the facts remain the same.
The doctrine provides that an appellate court's determination on a legal issue is binding on both the trial court on remand and on the appellate court on a subsequent appeal given the same case and substantially the same facts.
The ""law of the case"" doctrine, however, is one of policy only and will be disregarded when compelling circumstances call for a redetermination of a point of law on prior appeal. This is particularly true where an intervening or a contemporaneous change in law has occurred where former decisions have been overruled or new precedent has been established by controlling authority.
The ""law of the case"" doctrine precludes reconsideration of a previously decided issue unless one of three ""exceptional circumstances"" exists: (1) when substantially different evidence is raised at a subsequent trial, (2) when a subsequent contrary view of the law is decided by the controlling authority, or (3) when a decision is clearly erroneous and would result in a manifest injustice."	"Rachel, a small business owner, had been fighting a lawsuit against her former employee, John, who was claiming she owed him back wages. The case went to trial, and the judge ultimately ruled in favor of Rachel, determining that she did not owe John any back wages. John appealed the decision to the appeals court, but the appeals court affirmed the trial court's ruling and did not change the law.

The case was then remanded back to the trial court for further proceedings. On remand, the trial court resolved some ancillary issues, such as attorney's fees. John was unhappy with the resolution and again appealed to the same appeals court.

At the second appeal, John argued that the trial court was wrong in its original decision. However, the appeals court was bound by its prior decision, which established the law of the case. The court would not reconsider the issue of the back wages, as there was no substantially different evidence, no controlling authority had changed the law, and the original decision was not clearly erroneous.

In this scenario, the law of the case doctrine came into play. The appeals court was not allowed to reconsider the original decision, even though John had appealed again. The doctrine ensures stability and finality in the legal system, preventing the constant re-litigation of the same issues. It also promotes efficiency, as the court does not have to reconsider arguments that have already been resolved.

In this way, the law of the case doctrine helps to clarify the legal landscape, providing a sense of certainty and predictability for parties like Rachel and John, who are seeking legal resolution of their disputes."
Learned intermediary	"Learned intermediary is a defense doctrine used in the legal system of the United States.  This doctrine states that a manufacturer of a product has fulfilled its duty of care when it provides all of the necessary information to a ""learned intermediary"" who then interacts with the consumer of a product. This doctrine is primarily used by pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers in defense of tort suits. 
In a clear majority of states, the courts have accepted this as a liability shield for pharmaceutical companies. 
This doctrine was adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Hollis v Dow Corning Corp., 129 DLR 609 (1995)."	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of ""Learned Intermediary"":

Dr. Smith, a cardiologist, prescribed a new blood thinner, Linxerin, to her patient, Mrs. Johnson, for her heart condition. Linxerin was a new medication that required a special prescription and careful monitoring. The pharmaceutical company, Pharmacia, had provided Dr. Smith with a comprehensive package insert, including information about the potential side effects, dosage instructions, and contraindications.

Mrs. Johnson had a record of taking several medications and had a history of allergic reactions. Dr. Smith advised Mrs. Johnson about the side effects and benefits of Linxerin and monitored her while she took the medication. However, as Mrs. Johnson continued to take Linxerin, she experienced severe side effects that led to a serious injury.

Mrs. Johnson sued Pharmacia, claiming that they failed to adequately warn her about the risks associated with Linxerin. Pharmacica argued that they had fulfilled their duty of care by providing the necessary information to Dr. Smith as a ""learned intermediary.""

The court agreed with Pharmacica, ruling that as a medical professional, Dr. Smith was a learned intermediary between the company and the patient. By providing Dr. Smith with accurate and comprehensive information, Pharmacia had discharged their duty of care to inform Mrs. Johnson about the risks associated with Linxerin. The court held that Dr. Smith was responsible for communicating this information to Mrs. Johnson and for monitoring her condition, not Pharmacia."
Legal certainty	Legal certainty is a principle in national and international law which holds that the law must provide those subject to it with the ability to regulate their conduct.	"Here is a short story illustrating the concept of legal certainty:

**The Small Business Dilemma**

Samantha was a young entrepreneur who had just started a small café in a quaint town. She had invested her life savings into the business and worked tirelessly to make it a success. One day, while sourcing supplies from local farmers, she met Emma, a talented baker who offered to provide Samantha with fresh pastries at a competitive price. To ensure compliance with food regulations, Samantha asked Emma if she had obtained necessary permits and licenses. Emma vaguely mentioned that she had ""most of the necessary paperwork,"" but couldn't provide any concrete documentation.

Samantha was hesitant but reliant on the fresh pastries, so she accepted Emma's offer. However, a few days later, local health inspectors arrived at the café to investigate complaints about food handling practices. To Samantha's surprise, Emma's pastries were found to be prepared in an unlicensed kitchen, operated from a private residence. In fact, Emma hadn't bothered to register the kitchen or obtain the necessary permits. The inspectors shut down the café, citing that Samantha had unknowingly sourced goods from unlicensed premises.

**The Lesson in Legal Certainty**

In this scenario, Samantha was not provided with the legal certainty, in that she couldn't regulate her conduct (buying supplies from a registered premises) with confidence. The uncertainty around Emma's compliance creates a risk for Samantha. If the law had provided clear guidelines on sourcing food from licensed providers, Samantha could have made a more informed decision. This lack of clarity and predictability led to unintended consequences, such as the closure of her business."
Legal immunity	"Legal immunity, or immunity from prosecution, is a legal status wherein an individual or entity cannot be held liable for a violation of the law, in order to facilitate societal aims that outweigh the value of imposing liability in such cases. Such legal immunity may be from criminal prosecution, or from civil liability (being subject of lawsuit), or both. The most notable forms of legal immunity are parliamentary immunity and witness immunity. One author has described legal immunity as ""the obverse of a legal power"":

A party has an immunity with respect to some action, object or status, if some other relevant party – in this context, another state or international agency, or citizen or group of citizens – has no (power) right to alter the party's legal standing in point of rights or duties in the specified respect. There is a wide range of legal immunities that may be invoked in the name of the right to rule. In international law, immunities may be created when states assert powers of derogation, as is permitted, for example, from the European Convention on Human Rights ""in times of war or other public emergency."" Equally familiar examples include the immunities against prosecution granted to representatives (MPs or councillors) and government officials in pursuit of their duties. Such legal immunities may be suspect as potential violations of the rule of law, or regarded as quite proper, as necessary protections for the officers of the state in the rightful pursuit of their duties."	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of legal immunity:

**The Art of Anonymity**

As a seasoned investigative journalist, Rachel had been working tirelessly to expose corruption in local government. She had uncovered a web of deceit involving several high-ranking officials who had been embezzling funds meant for social welfare programs. However, her next target was one of those officials, a man named James, who had a cast-iron reputation for ruthlessness.

Determined to get a straight answer from James, Rachel went undercover and obtained a job in his department. One day, while reviewing his computer files, she discovered a link to a secret offshore account. Convinced she had the smoking gun, she decided to confront James about her findings.

In their meeting, James responded evasively, dodging and weaving around her questions. Infuriated, Rachel pressed him harder, but he simply threatened to sue her for libel if she published any details about the meeting.

A friend explained to Rachel that James had parliamentary immunity, which protected him from being held accountable for his actions while carrying out his official duties. According to this principle, public officials were safeguarded from prosecution and lawsuits as long as they were acting within the scope of their employment. Any statements or actions they took in their capacity as government officials were deemed outside the limits of judicial scrutiny. Rachel realized that her investigation had hit a brick wall.

The curious thing about immunity, however, was that it didn't protect James from disclosing sensitive information. Rachel made sure to carefully note that conversation, knowing that she could prosecute him civilly even if she couldn't challenge his immunity."
List of Latin legal terms	"A number of Latin terms are used in legal terminology and legal maxims. This is a partial list of these terms, which are wholly or substantially drawn from Latin, or anglicized Law Latin.

"	"As a young lawyer, Alex was tasked with drafting a legal document for a new business partnership. The partners, Maria and Tom, wanted to establish a 50/50 ownership split and clearly outline their roles and responsibilities.

Alex decided to use Latin legal terms to strengthen the document's precision and authority. She began by stating the ""principle of equity,"" ensuring that the partners would be treated fairly and impartially. The document also included the ""usus"" of the business's assets, outlining how they would be used for the benefit of both partners.

To define the partners' responsibilities, Alex referenced the ""onus probandi,"" placing the burden of proof on Tom to demonstrate his ability to manage the company's finances. She also included the ""clause rebus sic stantibus,"" which allowed for adjustments to the agreement if circumstances changed.

The document concluded with the ""actio personalis morale,"" stating that any disputes would be resolved through amicable negotiations rather than litigation.

When Maria and Tom signed the agreement, they felt confident that their partnership was secure and transparent. The Latin legal terms added a layer of sophistication and professionalism, and Alex's thorough drafting ensured that their business relationship would run smoothly.

Through this story, we see how Latin legal terms like ""principle of equity,"" ""onus probandi,"" and ""actio personalis morale"" can be used to create a clear and effective legal document. These terms add precision and authority to the agreement, helping to establish a mutually beneficial partnership."
Legal transplant	The term legal transplant was coined in the 1970s by the Scottish legal scholar W.A.J. 'Alan' Watson to indicate the moving of a rule or a system of law from one country to another (A. Watson, Legal Transplants: An Approach to Comparative Law, Edinburgh, 1974). The notion of legal transplantation is diffusionism-based and according to this concept most changes in most legal systems occur as the result of borrowing. As maintained by Watson, transplantation is the most fertile source of legal development.	"Here's a story to illustrate the concept of Legal Transplant:

**The Côte d'Ivoire Coffee Roasting Law**

In a small town in Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), coffee importing company, Joël's Roasts, adopts American-style ""cradle-to-grave"" liability from the US. Inspired by their American coffee-importing counterpart's experience, Joël's Roasts incorporates this principle into their own business model. This means that from soil-to-sea, every step in the coffee supply chain is now the liability of the coffee roasting company, Joël's Roasts.

Up until this point, the Côte d'Ivoire coffee industry had traditionally placed the obligation on small-scale farmer cooperatives for any potential shortcomings in the coffee supply chain.

Princeton University's Civil Procedure professor consults with prominent American legal thinkers and Côte d'Ivoire's bar association, becoming intrigued by the Côte d'Ivoire coffee case. Education to stakeholders as well as consultancy to politicians gathered feedback and academic-based review-roundtable presentations all aim to assure smooth applicant accommodation and incorporation's reformability.

This is an instance of Legal transplant."
Legality	Legality is the state of being consistent with the law, the construct of legal power, or lawfulness in a given jurisdiction.	"Here is a story illustrating the concept of 'Legality':

**The Rules of the Road**

It's 7:00 AM on a busy Monday morning. Emma is getting ready for work and needs to drive her children to school. As she is backing out of her driveway, she accidentally hits a pedestrian, Jack, who was jaywalking across the street. Emma was following all the rules of the road: she was driving at a safe speed, had her seatbelt on, and stopped at the stop sign before entering the street.

After the accident, Emma is concerned about what might happen next. Jack, who is shaken but unhurt, tells the police officer who arrives on the scene that he didn't see Emma's car and didn't signal as he crossed the street. Emma is cleared by the officer, citing that she was driving legally, following all traffic laws. Jack, however, can be cited for jaywalking.

The police officer's explanation highlights that Emma was in compliance with the law at the time of the accident, while Jack was not. This illustrates the concept of legality – it's not about what happened, but about whether or not the parties involved were following the rules. Emma's actions were lawful, even though they still resulted in an accident due to another person's actions. This distinction clarifies why Emma is not at fault and will likely not face any repercussions for the accident.

In contrast, Jack's decision to cross the street against traffic laws directly led to the accident, despite Emma's lawful driving. The scene demonstrates that legality is not a judgment on the morality or appropriateness of an action, but rather a simple evaluation of whether or not the action was in accordance with the rules and regulations in place."
Legality of the War on Drugs	Several authors have put forth arguments concerning the legality of the war on drugs. In his essay The Drug War and the Constitution, libertarian philosopher Paul Hager makes the case that the War on Drugs in the United States is an illegal form of prohibition, which violates the principles of a limited government embodied in the United States Constitution.	"It was a sunny day in the small town of Oakdale, where the smell of freshly cut grass filled the air and the local economy relied heavily on agriculture. Amidst the peaceful surroundings, a controversy brewed. James, a local farmer, had been growing cannabis on his property for medical purposes, as permitted by California state law. However, he was arrested by federal authorities and charged with federal drug trafficking offenses.

James argued that his actions were legal under state law and that the federal government had no jurisdiction to interfere. He pointed to Article VI of the US Constitution, which states that laws passed by the states take precedence over federal law when they conflict. He claimed that the War on Drugs was an example of federal overreach, violating the principles of a limited government by imposing its own laws on states that have differing views on the matter.

The court ultimately ruled against James, citing the Supremacy Clause (Article VI) which states that federal laws supersede state laws. The judge argued that federal drug laws took precedence over state medical cannabis laws, effectively making the entire War on Drugs an illegal form of prohibition.

James's case highlights the ongoing debate over the legality of the War on Drugs. Is it a federal issue or a state issue? Does the Supremacy Clause justify federal authority over state laws, or does the Constitution's principles of federalism protect state sovereignty? The controversy illuminates the complex issue of the War on Drugs and its implications on individual freedoms, state rights, and the integrity of the Constitution."
List of international and European laws on child protection and migration	The following is a list of international standards that are relevant to the protection of children in migration and mobility. These standards are legally binding conventions, treaties and directives. The international legal framework concerning children in migration and mobility provides safeguards in relation to asylum and international protection, labour regulations, the prevention of sexual exploitation and trafficking in human beings, international standards for migrant workers, child victims of crime and the judiciary, as well as international private law for child protection and family matters.	"**The Case of Maria and her Child**

Maria, a 25-year-old mother from Honduras, had fled her home country to escape the violence and poverty that had become unbearable. She had heard rumors of a better life in Europe, where her cousin had found work and started a new family. Determined to provide a safer future for her 7-year-old son, Juan, Maria embarked on a perilous journey to reach Spain, where she had heard of strong child protection laws.

Upon arrival, Maria applied for asylum, citing the danger she and her son had faced in Honduras. However, her application was initially rejected, as Spain's immigration authorities claimed that her country of origin did not meet the UNHCR's definition of persecution. Undeterred, Maria and Juan sought assistance from a local non-governmental organization (NGO) that specialized in child protection and migration.

The NGO helped Maria and Juan access essential services, including food, shelter, and medical care. They also guided Maria through the process of appealing the asylum decision. Meanwhile, under the OECD Convention, the International Labor Organization (ILO) protections ensured that Maria's son, Juan, was not forced to work alongside her, as a child under 14 years old is prohibited from engaging in labor.

Maria's appeal was ultimately successful, and she and Juan were granted refugee status. As part of the Warisha, the Hague Convention, they were allowed to reunite with Maria's cousin in Spain, who took in Juan temporarily. The case demonstrated the several international, European, and Spanish laws and standards that protect the rights of child migrants like Juan, ensuring their safety, reunification, and protection under international and national law."
Living tree doctrine	In Canadian law, the living tree doctrine (French: théorie de l'arbre vivant) is a doctrine of constitutional interpretation that says that a constitution is organic and must be read in a broad and progressive manner so as to adapt it to the changing times.	"Here's a short story that illustrates the living tree doctrine in action:

**The Changing Rights of Women in Canada**

It's 1960, and reporter Jane Smith is researching a story on the rights of women in Canada. She attends a conference in Vancouver where women are demanding greater equality in the workplace. As she listens to the speakers, Jane is struck by the remaining restrictions on women's rights in provinces like Quebec and British Columbia.

She discovers that in these provinces, women are still required to get their husband's permission to get employed, own property, or open a bank account. Jane is appalled that these laws date back to the 19th century, a time when women had far fewer rights.

Jane knows that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which everyone talks about, seems to prevent such restrictions. She consults with her colleague, a constitutional lawyer, who reminds her that the Charter, like a living tree, grows and adapts with the changing times. The lawyer explains that instead of strictly interpreting the Charter's words, judges must interpret it in a way that is relevant to modern society.

When the Constitution Act of 1982 made the Charter the supreme law of Canada, it effectively breathed life into the ""living tree doctrine."" This principle means that judges consider how provincial laws restrict women's rights in their historical context. By applying the Charter to these restrictions, judges will eventually rule them unconstitutional, gradually recognizing women's equality rights, in ways that might not have been explicit in the original text.

Jane writes her story, highlighting the spark of change within Canada's Constitution."
Loss of chance in English law	In English law, loss of chance refers to a particular problem of causation, which arises in tort and contract. The law is invited to assess hypothetical outcomes, either affecting the claimant or a third party, where the defendant's breach of contract or of the duty of care for the purposes of negligence deprived the claimant of the opportunity to obtain a benefit and/or avoid a loss. For these purposes, the remedy of damages is normally intended to compensate for the claimant's loss of expectation (alternative rationales include restitution and reliance). The general rule is that while a loss of chance is compensable when the chance was something promised on a contract it is not generally so in the law of tort, where most cases thus far have been concerned with medical negligence in the public health system.	As a user, you requested a story in approximately 150-300 words.
Mailbox rule	"The posting rule (or mailbox rule in the United States, also known as the ""postal rule"" or ""deposited acceptance rule"") is an exception to the general rule of contract law in common law countries that acceptance of an offer takes place when communicated. Under the posting rule, that acceptance takes effect when a letter is posted (that is, dropped in a post box or handed to a postal worker); the post office will be the universal service provider, such as the UK's Royal Mail, the Australia Post, or the United States Postal Service. In plain English, the ""meeting of the minds"" necessary to contract formation occurs at the exact moment word of acceptance is sent via post by the person accepting it, rather than when that acceptance is received by the person who offered the contract.
The rules of contracts by post (postal rules) include the following:

An offer made by post/letter is not effective until received by the offeree.
Acceptance is effective as soon as it is posted.
For revocation to be effective, it must be received by the offeree before they post their letter of acceptance.
One rationale given for the rule is that the offeror nominates the post office as his or her implied agent, and thus receipt of the acceptance by the post office is regarded as receipt by the offeror. The main effect of the posting rule is that the risk of acceptance being delivered late or lost in the post is placed upon the offeror. If the offeror is reluctant to accept this risk, he can always expressly require actual receipt as a condition before being legally bound by his offer."	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of the mailbox rule:

Emily had been planning a trip to Europe for months, and she landed a great deal on a flight to Paris. She carefully printed out a mail-in acceptance form, made sure to follow the instructions, and dropped it in the mailbox at the post office on her way to lunch.

Meanwhile, Emily's friend, Jack, who owned the travel agency, had mailed his offer letter to Emily two weeks prior to the deadline. The letter detailed the terms of the trip and invited her to accept by mail. According to the letter, acceptance would be deemed effective as soon as the letter was posted.

Back to Emily's sealed envelope... As she walked out of the post office, Emily wondered if her acceptance letter would arrive on time. The letter was carefully addressed, stamped, and posted with intention to ensure its safe arrival at Jack's agency. By her reasoning, Emily had already accepted the offer by letting the post office handle it, even if Jack wasn't yet aware of this action.

If the letter never made it to Jack's office before the client cutoff deadline, a contract would automatically be formed according to the accepted rules. This demonstrates the mailbox rule, where an acceptance through mail provides a legal result when the letter of acceptance has been posted, not when it is received by the offeror."
Major questions doctrine	"The major questions doctrine is a principle of statutory interpretation in United States administrative law under which, pursuant to recent Supreme Court precedent, courts have held that questions of major political or economic significance may not be delegated by Congress to executive agencies absent sufficiently clear and explicit authorization. It functions as a canon to limit broad assertions of implied powers, effectively reinforcing the role of legislative power.
The doctrine was articulated as a paradigm in FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. (2000), which advised ""common sense"" in assessing whether Congress intended to delegate broad regulatory powers. The phrase ""major questions"" first appeared in legal scholarship in 2008 and gained doctrinal status by 2016 with conservative legal organization support amid the deregulatory agenda of the first presidency of Donald Trump. Brett Kavanaugh used the term in a United States courts of appeals dissent, later describing it as a know-it-when-you-see-it principle in his 2017 Supreme Court confirmation hearing.
It was then applied in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA (2014) and King v. Burwell (2015), with Chief Justice John Roberts writing for the majority in the latter. The Court explicitly adopted the doctrine in West Virginia v. EPA (2022), holding that agencies must point to ""clear congressional authorization"" for the power asserted in ""extraordinary cases"". The Court characterized the doctrine as an identifiable body of case law addressing agencies repeatedly asserting transformative authority unsupported by legislative mandate.
Scholars distinguish between narrow forms of the doctrine, assessing reasonableness of interpretation as a Chevron deference limitation, and broader forms like the clear statement rule. The doctrine has been variously criticized for promotion of ""judicial self-aggrandizement"" and inconsistency with textualism, originalism, and norms of statutory interpretation. Mila Sohoni wrote that it portends to transform judicial review of agency action."	"Here's a story that illustrates the major questions doctrine:

Emily, a passionate environmental activist, had spent years advocating for stronger regulations on pollution from industrial farming practices. She was particularly concerned about the impact of chicken factory farms on water quality in rural communities. When a new president came into office, Emily's hopes for decisive action were raised when the Secretary of Agriculture issued a rule that would drastically reduce water pollution from large-scale agricultural operations.

The Secretary argued that the 1972 Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) gave the agency the implicit authority to regulate water pollution from any source, including agriculture. However, a group of chicken factory farms challenged the rule, arguing that it exceeded the authority granted to the Department.

The court was asked to decide whether the agency had the power to make such sweeping changes. In this case, a conservative judge pointed to a general statement in the FWPCA that the agency should ""reduce water pollution."" But, the judge argued, the statute didn't explicitly give the agency the power to dictate sweeping new regulations, like reducing the amount of manure per farm. ""Is this just a minor tweak to the water quality standards,"" the judge asked, ""or is this a fundamental overhaul of the entire agricultural industry?""

The court decided that, for the agency's action to be constitutional, there needed to be clear and explicit congressional authorization to exert such transformative authority. The agency's broad claim to power was deemed an encroachment on the legislative power of Congress. The court, thus, struck down the rule, citing the major questions doctrine, which asks: ""Can an agency undertake a fundamental transformation of the economy or society through an implicit delegation of power?"""
Male captus bene detentus	"Male captus, bene detentus (wrongly captured, properly detained) is a legal doctrine, according to which the fact that a person may have been wrongly or unfairly arrested, will not prejudice a rightful detention or trial under due process. 
There is state practice in support of the doctrine, as well as contrary state practice. In one of its cases the U.S. Supreme Court held that where a person from another country is apprehended by irregular means, the right to set up as defense the unlawful manner by which he was brought to a court belongs ""to the Government from whose territory he was wrongfully taken""."	"Juan walked out of his office building after a long day, lost in thought about a meeting he had that morning. As he was about to step into a taxi, two plainclothes police officers grabbed him and put him in handcuffs.

""What's going on?"" Juan demanded, shocked and frightened. ""I haven't done anything wrong!""

The officers didn't respond, but instead dragged him to a police car and drove him to the station. Juan was confused and scared, wondering how this was happening to him.

At the station, the police booked Juan and threw him into a cell. Hours went by before he was finally able to call a lawyer. His lawyer, Maria, arrived soon after and immediately sensed something was off.

Maria reviewed the evidence and discovered that the police had mistaken Juan for someone else, using a phony description and no concrete evidence to justify the arrest. But despite this, Maria knew that Juan had a right to a fair trial and presented his case in court.

The judge listened attentively, took into account the irregularities in Juan's arrest, and ultimately ruled in his favor. ""Although the fact that Juan was wrongly arrested and detained may be relevant, it does not prejudice the legitimate detention and trial under due process. The court will proceed with the case.""

Juan was relieved and grateful that justice had been served, despite the initial wrongdoing."
Margin of appreciation	"The margin of appreciation (or margin of state discretion) is a legal doctrine with a wide scope in international human rights law. It was developed by the European Court of Human Rights to judge whether a state party to the European Convention on Human Rights should be sanctioned for limiting the enjoyment of rights. The doctrine allows the court to reconcile practical differences in implementing the articles of the convention. Such differences create a limited right for contracting parties ""to derogate from the obligations laid down in the Convention"". The doctrine also reinforces the role of the European Convention as a supervisory framework for human rights. In applying that discretion, the court's judges must take into account differences between domestic laws of the contracting parties as they relate to substance and procedure. The margin of appreciation doctrine contains concepts that are analogous to the principle of subsidiarity, which occurs in the unrelated field of EU law. The purposes of the margin of appreciation are to balance individual rights with national interests and to resolve any potential conflicts. It has been suggested that the European Court should generally refer to the State's decision, as it is an international court, instead of a bill of rights.
The margin of appreciation doctrine has ""not found an explicit parallel development"" by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights."	"As a parent, Sarah had always been concerned about the safety of her children while playing in the school playground. She thought it was essential to have strict rules and close supervision to prevent accidents. However, the school administration had taken a different approach. They believed in giving children more freedom to learn through self-directed play and encouraged teachers to focus on more creative activities.

One day, Sarah noticed that a group of children were playing recklessly near a deep pond on the school's premises. She approached the teacher, Mrs. Johnson, who was supervising the children, and expressing her concern about the potential risks. Mrs. Johnson explained that the school had decided to take a more relaxed approach to playground supervision, allowing the children to learn from their own experiences and make responsible decisions.

Sarah felt frustrated, as this approach seemed to disregard the safety of the children. She feared that the school was not doing enough to protect them. However, after discussing the issue with Mrs. Johnson and other teachers, Sarah gained a better understanding of the school's strategy. She realized that they were balancing the children's need for freedom with the need for safety, and were also considering the developmental benefits of self-directed play.

In this scenario, the school has a ""margin of appreciation"" to make decisions about playground supervision, balancing the rights of the children to learn and have fun with the responsibility to ensure their safety. The school's approach may be different from what Sarah would have chosen, but within the bounds of the law, it is a reasonable exercise of discretion. The European Court of Human Rights' margin of appreciation doctrine recognizes that contracting parties may have different approaches to implementing human rights, as long as they do not infringe on the rights themselves. In this case, the school's approach may not be ideal for every parent, but it is a reasonable exercise of their discretion to ensure the best possible outcomes for the children."
María Clara doctrine	"The María Clara doctrine, also known as the Woman's Honor doctrine, is a legal doctrine applied by Philippine courts regarding cases that concern abuse against women. The doctrine is a presumption ""that women, especially Filipinas, would not admit that they have been abused unless that abuse had actually happened."" It was a part of case law in the Philippines for some considerable time but was repudiated by the Supreme Court of the Philippines in 2018."	"Here's a short story that illustrates the María Clara doctrine:

Maria, a 22-year-old Filipino college student, confides in her best friend, Rachel, about her troubled relationship with her boyfriend, Carlo. Maria tells Rachel that Carlo is physically and emotionally abusive, often pushing her around and insulting her. Rachel is shocked and concerned for Maria's well-being. Despite Maria's hesitation, Rachel encourages her to file a case against Carlo.

At trial, Carlo's lawyer questions Maria about the bruises on her face and arms, and she testifies that Carlo did it. The lawyer then aggressively cross-examines Maria, trying to discredit her and make it seem like she was exaggerating or even fabricating the allegations. The judge, applying the María Clara doctrine, assumes that Maria would not admit to being abused unless it indeed happened. This means that the court gives more weight to Maria's testimony, considering that she would not ""dishonor"" herself by admitting to such a shameful claim unless it were true.

In this scenario, the María Clara doctrine recognizes that women, particularly Filipinas, might not readily admit to abuse due to societal pressures and cultural expectations that prioritize female modesty and reputation. By assuming that the victim is telling the truth, the doctrine acknowledges the difficulties women face in reporting abuse and seeks to protect them from potential harm.

(Note: This story is fictional, but it is inspired by real-life cases and the implications of the María Clara doctrine.)"
Market share liability	Market share liability is a legal doctrine that allows a plaintiff to establish a prima facie case against a group of product manufacturers for an injury caused by a product, even when the plaintiff does not know from which defendant the product originated. The doctrine is unique to the law of the United States and apportions liability among the manufacturers according to their share of the market for the product giving rise to the plaintiff's injury.	"It's a typical Friday evening for Sarah, who heads to the ice cream shop with her friends. They order their usual favorites, Happy Cream's mint chip and Sweet Delights' strawberry. Unbeknownst to Sarah, the ice cream shop owner, Larry, has been cutting corners by using a cheaper, inferior ice cream mix from multiple suppliers instead of one reputable source.

Sarah enjoys her ice cream, but a few days later, she develops a severe stomachache and diarrhea. After running some tests, her doctor confirms that she has food poisoning caused by a specific type of bacteria commonly found in contaminated dairy products.

Sarah decides to sue Larry and the ice cream shop for causing her illness. In court, it becomes apparent that Larry didn't keep proper records of the ice cream mix suppliers, making it difficult to pinpoint which product caused the contamination.

However, the judge allows the case to proceed under the doctrine of market share liability. The court introduces evidence that Happy Cream and Sweet Delights made up 70% and 30% of the ice cream market, respectively. Based on this information, the court determines that Sarah has a 70% chance of contracting food poisoning from a Happy Cream ice cream and a 30% chance from a Sweet Delights ice cream.

As a result, Happy Cream is held responsible for 70% of Sarah's damages, while Sweet Delights is held responsible for 30%. This ruling allows Sarah to hold both companies accountable for their share of the blame, even though she never knew which specific product she consumed."
Mater semper certa est	"In Roman law, mater semper certa est (from Latin: ""the mother is always certain"") is a legal principle which has the power of praesumptio iuris et de iure (""presumption of law and by law""), meaning that no counter-evidence can be made against this principle. It provides that the mother of the child is conclusively established, from the moment of birth, by the mother's role in the birth. 
Since egg donation, or embryo donation with surrogacy, started using the technique of in-vitro fertilization, the principle of mater semper certa est has been shaken, since a child may have a genetic and a gestational (""birth""), let alone a ""social"", mother who are different individuals. Since then some countries have converted the old natural law to an equivalent codified law; in 1997 Germany introduced paragraph 1591 Mutterschaft (""motherhood"") of the BGB (civil code) reading Mutter eines Kindes ist die Frau, die es geboren hat (""the mother of a child is the woman who gave birth to it""). This has also been tested in the British case of Freddy McConnell.
The Roman law principle, however, does not stop at the mother, in fact it continues with pater semper incertus est (""The father is always uncertain""). This was regulated by the law of pater est, quem nuptiae demonstrant (""the father is he to whom marriage points""; see presumption of legitimacy). Essentially paternity fraud had originally been a marriage fraud in the civil code due to this principle. Today some married fathers use the modern tools of DNA testing to ensure a certainty on their fatherhood."	"As a young journalist, Sophia had always been fascinated by the intricacies of family law. So, when her new colleague, Alex, approached her with a personal dilemma, Sophia was only too happy to lend an ear.

Alex had just discovered that her husband, James, was not the biological father of her 18-month-old daughter, Emily. The truth had come to light when James had been tested for paternity due to a health issue, and the results revealed that he was not Emily's biological father.

Sophia sat stunned as Alex recounted the events that had led to this revelation. Despite the surprise, Sophia remained analytical and began to explain the legal concept of ""mater semper certa est"" to Alex. She explained that, under this principle, the mother of a child was always considered to be the woman who gave birth to the child, regardless of any contrary evidence.

In this case, Alex, as the birth mother, would be considered Emily's mother without a doubt, regardless of the circumstances surrounding her conception. The law would presume that Alex was Emily's mother, and no counter-evidence would be admissible to challenge this claim.

As Alex processed this information, Sophia reassured her that the same principle did not apply to the father. The law, prior to wide-scale paternity testing, had often relied on marriage as a determining factor in establishing paternity. In modern times, however, the rise of DNA testing had altered the landscape, allowing individuals to establish their paternity with greater certainty.

As the two friends continued to discuss the complexities of family law, Sophia hoped that Alex would find closure and comfort in knowing that, despite the unexpected twist, her love and bond with Emily remained unchanged."
Maxims of equity	Maxims of equity are legal maxims that serve as a set of general principles or rules which are said to govern the way in which equity operates. They tend to illustrate the qualities of equity, in contrast to the common law, as a more flexible, responsive approach to the needs of the individual, inclined to take into account the parties' conduct and worthiness. They were developed by the English Court of Chancery and other courts that administer equity jurisdiction, including the law of trusts. Although the most fundamental and time honored of the maxims, listed on this page, are often referred to on their own as the 'maxims of equity' or 'the equitable maxims', it cannot be said that there is a definitive list of them. Like other kinds of legal maxims or principles, they were originally, and sometimes still are, expressed in Latin.	"Here is a short story that illustrates the concept of Maxims of Equity:

**The Case of Mrs. Thompson and Mr. Jenkins**

Mrs. Thompson, a kind-hearted elderly woman, lives in a small village where she has raised her family for decades. Her home, which has been in her family for 50 years, has a beautiful garden that has been lovingly tended to by her and her late husband. After their passing, Mrs. Thompson lives there with her son, John, who has cared for her selflessly since childhood.

However, their wealthy neighbor, Mr. Jenkins, who has always coveted the property, offered to buy the house from them four years ago but was rejected by Mrs. Thompson, who is 75 and elderly. Nevertheless, Mr. Jenkins frequently encroaches on Mrs. Thompson's property, claiming that her fence is on his land and that she has created a trespass when installing a new shed. Feeling harassed and intimidated, Mrs. Thompson has sought help from her local lawyer.

A court of equity would consider the facts of the case and likely apply the maxim ""_Ubi jus, ibi remedium_"" (""Where there is a right, there is a remedy""). The court would acknowledge Mrs. Thompson's right to quiet enjoyment of her property, as well as her rights to her garden and shed, rather than simply focusing on Mr. Jenkins' property interests.

Equity recognizes that Mrs. Thompson and John have acted in good faith and that Mr. Jenkins has conducted himself in an unneighborly and harassing manner. The court might also apply the maxim ""_Melior est conditio possidentis_"" (""The condition of the possessor is the better one""). This suggests that since the neighbor (Mr. Jenkins) is acting unlawfully by maintaining trespass and harassment, he should be penalized by the court if he continues to encroach on Mrs. Thompson's property."
Maxwellisation	"Maxwellisation is the legal practice in English and Scots law that allows anyone who is criticised in an official report to respond prior to publication, based on details of the criticism received in advance.
The process takes its name from the publisher Robert Maxwell. In 1969, Maxwell was criticised in a report by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) as ""unfit to hold the stewardship of a public company"". Maxwell took the matter to court, where the DTI was said by the judge to have ""virtually committed the business murder"" of Maxwell. To avoid any repeat following the ruling, official policy was altered to ensure that prior notice would be given of critical findings. Relevant witnesses are shown the specific extracts of reports relating to them."	"Professor Thompson, a well-respected expert in her field, was invited to review a report on a major medical breakthrough by the National Institute of Health. As she delved into the document, she noticed that the report criticized her publicly-funded research project, stating that her team's findings were inconclusive and lacked sufficient evidence.

Feeling blindsided and concerned about the potential impact on her career, Professor Thompson sought legal advice. Her lawyer explained that she was entitled to exercise her right to Maxwellisation. This meant that she would receive advance notice of the criticisms in the report, allowing her to respond and provide a rebuttal before publication.

With this opportunity, Professor Thompson was able to review the specific extracts of the report that related to her team's research. She carefully crafted a response, addressing each criticism and providing evidence to support her claims. The National Institute of Health took her concerns seriously and incorporated her feedback into the final report.

When the report was published, Professor Thompson felt vindicated and relieved. The criticisms had been substantiated, but she was grateful for the chance to defend her work and reputation. The Maxwellisation process allowed her to clear her name and maintain her professional integrity. This legal concept gave her the power to address the criticisms head-on, ensuring that her reputation was protected and her contributions to the field were accurately recognized."
Medical necessity	"Medical necessity is a legal doctrine in the United States related to activities that may be justified as reasonable, necessary, and/or appropriate based on evidence-based clinical standards of care. In contrast, unnecessary health care lacks such justification.
Other countries may have medical doctrines or legal rules covering broadly similar grounds. The term clinical medical necessity is also used."	"Dr. Patel's patient, 42-year-old Sarah, was diagnosed with stage III breast cancer. The tumor had spread to her lymph nodes, and her oncologist recommended a mastectomy to increase her chances of survival. Sarah was devastated, but she understood the importance of the procedure.

As she was preparing for the surgery, her insurer told her that they wouldn't cover the mastectomy because it wasn't ""medically necessary"" according to their definition. The insurer claimed that Sarah's cancer wasn't advanced enough to warrant such an invasive procedure, and that alternative treatments would be sufficient.

Dr. Patel was shocked and consulted with Sarah's medical team. They explained that while alternative treatments like chemotherapy and radiation could help slow the cancer's growth, a mastectomy was still the most effective way to treat Sarah's specific condition. The tumor's location and size necessitated the removal of the affected breast to prevent the cancer from spreading and to improve Sarah's overall prognosis.

Dr. Patel and the medical team documented the medically necessary treatment plan, citing evidence-based guidelines and peer-reviewed research to support their decision. The insurer eventually relented, recognizing the medical necessity of the mastectomy. Sarah underwent the surgery and went on to make a full recovery.

This scenario illustrates the concept of medical necessity, where evidence-based clinical standards of care justify a particular treatment or procedure as necessary to achieve the best possible outcome for a patient's specific condition."
Meeting of the minds	"Meeting of the minds (also referred to as mutual agreement, mutual assent, or consensus ad idem) is a phrase in contract law used to describe the intentions of the parties forming the contract. In particular, it refers to the situation where there is a common understanding in the formation of the contract. Formation of a contract is initiated with a proposal or offer. This condition or element is considered a requirement to the formation of a contract in some jurisdictions.

"	"It's a crisp autumn morning when Emma, a freelance graphic designer, meets with Jack, the owner of a small business, to discuss designing a new logo for his company. Jack explains his vision - a modern, bold design that will stand out in the industry. Emma listens carefully and asks clarifying questions to ensure she understands his expectations.

Over a cup of coffee, Emma presents a few concept designs to Jack, and he provides feedback. Emma takes notes and asks if Jack wants to explore any changes. Jack nods, indicating he likes the direction they're heading. Emma asks if she should proceed with the designs. Jack gives her the thumbs-up, saying, ""You're close, go ahead and finalize the design.""

This scenario illustrates the concept of ""meeting of the minds."" Emma and Jack have reached a mutual understanding about the project scope, expectations, and intentions. They've communicated effectively, and their shared understanding has led to a common agreement on the design project.

Their conversation is key to this ""meeting of the minds."" Emma's initial proposal, followed by Jack's feedback and Emma's revisions, created a collaborative process. As they exchanged ideas, their understanding of each other's intentions grew, ultimately resulting in a shared goal: a new logo for Jack's company that meets his desired design.

In this case, the ""meeting of the minds"" forms the foundation of a valid contract between Emma and Jack. Their mutual agreement and common understanding will serve as the benchmark for the design project's success."
Merger doctrine (civil procedure)	"The merger doctrine in civil procedure stands for the proposition that when litigants agree to a settlement, and then seek to have their settlement incorporated into a court order, the court order actually extinguishes the settlement and replaces it with the authority of the court to supervise the behavior of the parties. Under this doctrine, the court is free to modify its order as necessary to achieve justice in the case, and may hold a party that breaches the agreement in contempt of court.
In U.S criminal law, merger doctrine holds that if a defendant has committed acts that simultaneously meet the elements of a more serious and less serious offense, the defendant may be charged with the more serious offense and the lesser offense drops in order to avoid implicating double jeopardy."	"Meet Sarah, a ambitious entrepreneur who co-founded a successful tech startup with her business partner, Alex. As the company grew, the partnership agreement began to fray, and the two rivals found themselves locked in a bitter dispute over ownership and control. Litigation ensued, and after months of tense negotiations, Sarah and Alex finally agreed on a settlement: Sarah would purchase Alex's shares and assume full ownership of the company.

Their lawyers drafted a settlement agreement, which both parties signed and submitted to the court for approval. The judge read the agreement, nodded in satisfaction, and ordered the settlement as part of the final decree. But then, something unexpected happened. Alex began to withhold crucial company documents, citing the settlement as grounds for his refusal. Sarah sought court intervention, claiming he was violating the settlement.

This is where the merger doctrine comes in. The judge now views the settlement as merely a proposal that has merged with the court's order. The court can modify the order to ensure justice in the case, and it sees Alex's breach as a violation of the court's order. The judge thus held Alex in contempt, requiring him to produce the documents and pay fines until he complied.

In this scenario, the merger doctrine ensures that the court retains control over the parties' actions, even after a settlement is agreed upon."
Merger doctrine (copyright law)	"The idea–expression distinction or idea–expression dichotomy is a legal doctrine in the United States that limits the scope of copyright protection by differentiating an idea from the expression or manifestation of that idea.
Unlike patents, which may confer proprietary rights in relation to general ideas and concepts per se when construed as methods, copyrights cannot confer such rights.  An adventure novel provides an illustration of the concept. Copyright may subsist in the work as a whole, in the particular story or characters involved, or in any artwork contained in the book, but generally not in the idea or genre of the story. Copyright, therefore, may not subsist in the idea of a man venturing out on a quest, but may subsist in a particular story that follows that pattern. Similarly, if the methods or processes described in a work are patentable, they may be the subject of various patent claims, which may or may not be broad enough to cover other methods or processes based on the same idea. Arthur C. Clarke, for example, sufficiently described the concept of a communications satellite (a geostationary satellite used as a telecommunications relay) in a 1945 paper that was not considered patentable in 1954 when it was developed at Bell Labs."	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of the Merger doctrine:

Emily had always been passionate about science fiction and wrote her own novels on the side. She finally finished her magnum opus, an epic space adventure about a group of rebels fighting against an evil alien empire. The story included unique space ships, alien species, and intergalactic battles.

Meanwhile, NASA was developing a real-life spacecraft designed specifically for intergalactic travel. The beauty of the spacecraft's design and functionality was all over social media, and Emily was inspired by it. She decided to incorporate similar elements into her novel, including the spacecraft's design and functionality.

As Emily's novel gained popularity, a producer took notice and wanted to adapt it into a movie. However, NASA warned the producer that they had already patented several of the technology ideas featured in the story, including the spacecraft design.

The court ruled in favor of NASA, stating that the idea of a spacecraft designed for intergalactic travel was not protectable by copyright. However, the specific design and functionality of the spacecraft in Emily's novel were protectable, as they were not the same as the patented technology.

In this scenario, the court applied the Merger doctrine, separating the idea of a spacecraft from the expression of that idea. The idea itself was not eligible for copyright protection, but the original expression in Emily's novel was protected. This concept illustrates that copyright law protects the specific expression of an idea, not the idea itself.

From a legal perspective, this scenario demonstrates how the Merger doctrine works in practice."
Merger doctrine (family law)	"Historically, the merger doctrine (a.k.a. ""doctrine of merger"") was the notion that marriage caused a woman's legal identity to merge with that of her husband.
Thus, a woman could not sue or testify against her husband any more than he could sue or testify against himself. Since her identity had merged with his, the two were now considered one legal entity."	"As they exchanged vows, Sarah and Alex's friends and family rejoiced at the union of the ambitious entrepreneur and the free-spirited artist. But little did they know, Sarah was about to lose her independence - legally speaking.

Sarah's best friend, Rachel, needed her help with a project, but Sarah was about to embark on a new business venture with Alex. Rachel asked Sarah to sign a contract on her behalf, but Sarah hesitated. Alex overheard the conversation and interjected, ""Why don't we just deal with Rachel together? After all, we're one now.""

Sarah was puzzled. Hadn't she always been her own person? Didn't she have her own thoughts, feelings, and opinions? Alex assured her it was for the best, that marriage meant they were now one unit. Sarah began to feel uneasy, but she didn't want to rock the boat.

As the months passed, Sarah found herself struggling to make decisions on her own. Alex would handle the finances, and she was expected to follow suit. Rachel asked her to sign a new contract, but when Sarah tried to take sole responsibility, Alex intervened, saying it would be better if they signed together. Sarah realized that her identity had, indeed, merged with Alex's. She was now one with him, and their individual rights and freedoms had been extinguished. This merger doctrine, steeped in history, had rendered Sarah a mere extension of Alex, leaving her wondering if she had lost her voice in the process."
Merger doctrine (property law)	"In the law of real property, the merger doctrine stands for the proposition that the contract for the conveyance of property merges into the deed of conveyance; therefore, any guarantees made in the contract that are not reflected in the deed are extinguished when the deed is conveyed to the buyer of the property.

"	"Here's a story illustrating the merger doctrine:

**The Deal on Elm Street**

Lena, a first-time homebuyer, negotiated a contract with the owner of a charming old house on Elm Street to purchase the property for $250,000. As part of the contract, the seller, James, agreed to fix a leaky roof within three months of the sale date ""to ensure the buyer's safety."" However, the contract didn't explicitly state this promise in writing.

A month later, Lena and James settled on a purchase price, and the deed was drafted and signed. In the deed, it was explicitly stated that James was conveying the property in ""as-is"" condition, with no guarantees or warranties. Lena moved into the house a few weeks later, but when a strong storm hit, the roof leak turned into a flood. The water damaged the walls, ceiling, and furniture.

Lena realized that there was no mention of the roof repair in the deed, unlike in their original contract. At this point, it became clear that the contractual promise had been extinguished. Since the deed was the official document that transferred ownership, any promises not included in the deed, like the promise to fix the roof, were no longer considered binding.

Disappointed, Lena had to hire a contractor to repair the damages at her own expense. This was the effect of the merger doctrine – any obligations not written into the deed, in this case the promise to fix the roof, were effectively washed away, leaving Lena with the financial burden of repairing the property."
Merger doctrine (trust law)	"In trust law the term ""doctrine of merger"" refers to the fusing of legal and equitable title in the event the same person becomes both the sole trustee and the sole beneficiary of a trust. In such a case, the trust is sometimes deemed to have terminated (with the result that the beneficiary owns the trust property outright)."	"Emily valued her weekly art classes at the community center above all else. When she and her aunt, Margaret, created a trust to benefit Emily's art education, Emily was thrilled. Margaret became the trustee and appointed herself as the sole beneficiary of the trust. The trust was funded with a generous gift from their family's estate, allowing Emily to pursue her passion for painting without worrying about tuition costs.

As Emily's artistic talents flourished, Margaret continued to manage the trust, using its assets to cover Emily's art supplies, classes, and travel opportunities to study abroad. However, at some point, Margaret realized she was getting older and decided to take on one final artistic project. She chose to return to college, enrolling in art classes at the same community center where Emily had her own lessons. Margaret housed her new art supplies, acting as the sole trustee managing the two art supplies equipment and materials.

Since Margaret was both the sole trustee and sole beneficiary, the trust law concept of merger applies. In essence, all the assets of the trust now belong to Margaret, and the separation between legal and equitable title to the property is no longer favorable, so the trust of itself becomes transformed. Once Margaret's personal assets and trust's are finally dissolved as separate pools of assets, Margaret has full ownership and control of all assets in her name."
Mirror image rule	In the law of contracts, the mirror image rule, also referred to as an unequivocal and absolute acceptance requirement, states that an offer must be accepted exactly with no modifications. The offeror is the master of his own offer. An attempt to accept the offer on different terms instead creates a counter-offer, and this constitutes a rejection of the original offer.	"Meet Sarah, a talented graphic designer, and Michael, a startup entrepreneur. Sarah and Michael had been chatting online for weeks about a potential project. Sarah had sent Michael a proposal outlining the scope of work, timeline, and payment terms. Michael was thrilled with the proposal and wanted to work with Sarah.

Here's what happened next: Michael sent Sarah an email saying, ""I love your proposal! Let's work together, but I want to add one more thing: I'll need you to design a logo for my company in addition to the original scope of work."" Sarah, excited about the project, replied, ""That sounds great! Yes, I can definitely add the logo design to our agreement. I'll send an updated proposal with the details.""

From a legal perspective, Michael's initial email was an attempt to accept Sarah's proposal with a modification (the logo design). This didn't qualify as an acceptance of the original offer. Instead, it created a counter-offer, which effectively rejected Sarah's original proposal. Sarah's response, even though she was willing to accommodate Michael's request, was actually an acceptance of his counter-offer, not the original proposal.

This scenario illustrates the mirror image rule. The rule states that an offer must be accepted exactly, without any modifications. Since Michael's initial email was not an acceptance of the original proposal, it didn't constitute a binding contract. The story underscores the importance of precise and unambiguous communication in contractual negotiations to avoid misunderstandings and ensure a smooth agreement."
Mistake (contract law)	"In contract law, a mistake is an erroneous belief, at contracting, that certain facts are true.  It can be argued as a defense, and if raised successfully, can lead to the agreement in question being found void ab initio or voidable, or alternatively, an equitable remedy may be provided by the courts. Common law has identified three different types of mistake in contract: the 'unilateral mistake', the 'mutual mistake', and the 'common mistake'.  The distinction between the 'common mistake' and the 'mutual mistake' is important.
Another breakdown in contract law divides mistakes into four traditional categories: unilateral mistake, mutual mistake, mistranscription, and misunderstanding.
The law of mistake in any given contract is governed by the law governing the contract.  The law from country to country can differ significantly. For instance, contracts entered into under a relevant mistake have not been voidable in English law since Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris (International) Ltd (2002).

"	"Meet Sarah, a freelance graphic designer, who was excited to take on a new project with a prestigious ad agency. The agency's Art Director, John, contacted her with a brief for a logo design for their new client, a high-end jewelry store. Sarah accepted the project, assuming that the jewelry store was a well-established player in the market.

However, upon further research, Sarah discovered that the jewelry store was actually a small startup with no significant online presence. She felt duped and considered withdrawing from the project. John, however, convinced her to proceed, assuring her that the jewelry store's reputation would only grow in the future.

As it turned out, the jewelry store went bankrupt soon after. Sarah's design was never used, and she never earned a dime. She argued in court that John's mistake about the jewelry store's reputation led to the voidable contract, and therefore, she should not be liable for the breach.

In this scenario, the mistake refers to John's misconception about the jewelry store's reputation, which was not true. As a unilateral mistake, John's error was not shared by Sarah, who believed the accurate information. The court may rule in Sarah's favor, declaring the contract voidable due to the mistaken assumption.

This relatable story illustrates the concept of mistake in contract law, highlighting the difference between mutual and unilateral mistakes, as well as the importance of understanding the concept in a specific legal context."
Mootness	"The terms moot, mootness and moot point are used both in English and in American law, although with significantly different meanings.
In the legal system of the United States, a matter is ""moot"" if further legal proceedings with regard to it can have no effect, or events have placed it beyond the reach of the law. Thereby the matter has been deprived of practical significance or rendered purely academic.
The U.S. development of this word stems from the practice of moot courts, in which hypothetical or fictional cases were argued as a part of legal education. These purely academic settings led the U.S. courts to describe cases where developing circumstances made any judgment ineffective as ""moot"".
The mootness doctrine can be compared to the ripeness doctrine, another court rule (rather than law), that holds that judges should not rule on cases based entirely on anticipated disputes or hypothetical facts. These rules and similar doctrines, taken together, prevent the federal courts of the United States from issuing advisory opinions, as required by the Case or Controversy Clause of the United States Constitution.
The usage in the British legal system, on the other hand, is that the term ""moot"" has the meaning of ""remains open to debate"" or ""remains unresolved"". The divergence in usage was first observed in the United States, and the extent to which the U.S. definition is used in U.S. jurisprudence and public discourse has ensured it is rarely used in a British courtroom. This is partially to avoid ambiguity, but also because the British definition is rarely relevant in practical cases."	"Emily had been suing her former employer for wrongful termination, alleging that she was fired due to her disabilities. The case was making its way through the court system, with both sides presenting evidence and arguments. However, as the trial approached, Emily's employer suddenly offered her a new job within the company, with full pay and benefits, and a guarantee that she would no longer be subjected to the same hostile environment that had led to her termination.

Emily was thrilled with the offer and accepted it. The judge, in reviewing the case, noted that the situation had changed dramatically since the lawsuit was filed. Emily was now gainfully employed and satisfied with her working conditions. In light of this new reality, the judge declared the case ""moot.""

The judge ruled that the case no longer had any practical significance or effect, as Emily was now employed and her rights were being protected by her new job. Further legal proceedings would serve no purpose since the dispute was no longer relevant. The judge dismissed the case, citing that it was now moot.

In this scenario, the court determined that the case was meaningless and lacked practical significance, given the change in circumstances. The effort and money spent on the lawsuit were essentially wasted, as the case could no longer be resolved in a way that would change Emily's situation. The concept of mootness highlights the importance of ensuring that court cases remain relevant and focused on current, real-world issues, rather than hypothetical or hypothetical disputes."
Moral certainty	Moral certainty is a concept of intuitive probability. It means a very high degree of probability, sufficient for action, but short of absolute or mathematical certainty.	"Here's a story that hopefully illustrates the concept of moral certainty:

Samantha, a software engineer, had been working on a new project for three months. She and her team had been under a tight deadline to deliver the finished product to their biggest client, a leading tech company. On the last day of work before the deadline, Samantha's boss received an email claiming that a rival company, TechX, had stolen the project's intellectual property.

Samantha's boss reviewed the evidence, including cryptic messages on an encrypted chat forum, suspicious meetings between TechX representatives and former engineers from their company, and suspicious IP addresses tracked on their internal servers. Although there was no concrete proof, it was clear that something fishy was going on.

Given the circumstances, Samantha's boss knew they had to act swiftly to protect their client's interests. They decided to send an official notice to TechX, requesting they cease and desist from using their intellectual property. Although the evidence didn't rise to the level of absolute certainty, there was a high degree of moral certainty that TechX had indeed stolen the intellectual property. Samantha's boss acted on that intuition, knowing that the consequences of delaying action would be severe.

In this scenario, Samantha's boss may not have had absolute or mathematical certainty that TechX stole the intellectual property, but they had a strong moral certainty that it was likely true. This intuition guided their decision to take action, illustrating how moral certainty is often the currency of decision-making in real-life legal and professional contexts."
Mosaic theory (US law)	"The mosaic theory is a legal doctrine in American courts for considering issues of information collection, government transparency, and search and seizure, especially in cases involving invasive or large-scale data collection by government entities. The theory takes its name from mosaic tile art: while an entire picture can be seen from a mosaic's tiles at a distance, no clear picture emerges from viewing a single tile in isolation. The mosaic theory calls for a cumulative understanding of data collection by law enforcement and analyzes searches ""as a collective sequence of steps rather than individual steps."" 
Although the doctrine was first used in cases about national security, five justices of the US Supreme Court authored concurring opinions supporting a new Fourth Amendment framework for judging whether or not an individual has been subjected to an unlawful search, in United States v. Jones (2012). Under this framework, the US government's actions should be considered collectively rather than independently for determining whether or not the acts constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment. It requires that police action is considered ""over time as a collective 'mosaic' of surveillance,"" and allows that cumulative mosaic to qualify as a protected Fourth Amendment search, even if the individual steps that contribute to the full picture do not reach that constitutional threshold in isolation. 
Critics of the Fourth Amendment use of mosaic theory argue that it is difficult to administer and inconsistent with other Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. Proponents, on the other hand, argue that mosaic theory is a much-needed development in light of new technologies that allow law enforcement officers to collect large volumes of personal data with little effort. Human rights workers and legal scholars have been critical of how mosaic theory in national security cases undermines civil rights. They argue that when government agencies claim that any scrap of information is part of a larger intelligence mosaic, those agencies get free rein to determine what of their work will be kept secret. This method is used by American intelligence analysts."	"Meet Sarah, a young journalist who had been investigating a high-profile scandal involving city officials. The city mayor, a powerful figure in the community, had become suspicious of Sarah's snooping and ordered his team of detectives to find out what she knew.

The detectives started by monitoring Sarah's social media accounts, taking screenshots of her tweets and posts. They also installed keylogger software on her home computer, allowing them to track every website she visited and every email she sent.

At first, it seemed like these individual actions didn't amount to much. Sarah had taken innocent-looking likes on social media, and her emails were mostly mundane communications with sources and colleagues.

However, as the detectives continued to collect data over several weeks, a different picture emerged. They noticed a pattern of Sarah's online activity that suggested she was getting close to uncovering a major scandal. They also found a string of email exchanges hinting at a high-level conspiracy.

Under the mosaic theory, the detectives' individual actions were combined to create a larger picture of surveillance. The courts used this collective data to determine that the detectives had, in fact, conducted an unlawful search and seizure of Sarah's digital life.

In this scenario, the mosaic theory allowed the courts to consider the cumulative effect of the detectives' actions, rather than each individual step in isolation. It recognized that the detectives' goal was to gather information about Sarah, and that the individual actions were not isolated incidents, but part of a larger pattern of surveillance."
Mount Laurel doctrine	"The Mount Laurel doctrine is a significant judicial doctrine of the New Jersey State Constitution. The doctrine requires that municipalities use their zoning powers in an affirmative manner to provide a realistic opportunity for the production of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income households.
The doctrine takes its name from the lead case in which it was first pronounced by the New Jersey Supreme Court in 1975: Southern Burlington County N.A.A.C.P. v. Mount Laurel Township (commonly called Mount Laurel I), in which the plaintiffs challenged the zoning ordinance of Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey, on the grounds that it operated to exclude low and moderate income persons from obtaining housing in the municipality.

"	"Once upon a time in the charming town of Willowdale, a diverse community with a mix of affluent and working-class families. The town's Mayor, Jane, was happy to see the steady growth of the town, but noticed that affordable housing was getting scarce. Long-time residents, like Maria, a single mother working two jobs to support her kids, were facing a daunting struggle to find a place to call home.

A local non-profit organization, Community Developments Inc. (CDI), decided to take action. They approached the Mayor with a plan to build a new affordable housing development, featuring 50 units with rent caps ensuring that low- and moderate-income families could afford to live there. CDI proposed allocating a 5-acre parcel of land within the town's limits, which was previously used as a neglected parking lot.

However, the town's Planning Board, led by Councilman Tom, raised concerns about the project's impact on the town's character and property values. They opposed the development, citing zoning ordinances that prioritized single-family homes and commercial spaces. CDI appealed the decision to the New Jersey Superior Court, citing the Mount Laurel doctrine.

With the court's intervention, the town was forced to re-examine its zoning policies. The court ruled that Willowdale must take affirmative action to address the lack of affordable housing, ensuring that low- and moderate-income residents, like Maria, had a realistic opportunity to find a home in the town. The town eventually approved the CDI project, and the community celebrated the arrival of the new affordable housing development."
Natural justice	"In English law, natural justice is technical terminology for the rule against bias (nemo iudex in causa sua) and the right to a fair hearing (audi alteram partem). While the term natural justice is often retained as a general concept, it has largely been replaced and extended by the general ""duty to act fairly"".
The basis for the rule against bias is the need to maintain public confidence in the legal system. Bias can take the form of actual bias, imputed bias, or apparent bias. Actual bias is very difficult to prove in practice whereas imputed bias, once shown, will result in a decision being void without the need for any investigation into the likelihood or suspicion of bias. Cases from different jurisdictions currently apply two tests for apparent bias: the ""reasonable suspicion of bias"" test and the ""real likelihood of bias"" test. One view that has been taken is that the differences between these two tests are largely semantic and that they operate similarly.
The right to a fair hearing requires that individuals should not be penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the case, a fair opportunity to answer it, and the opportunity to present their own case. The mere fact that a decision affects rights or interests is sufficient to subject the decision to the procedures required by natural justice. In Europe, the right to a fair hearing is guaranteed by Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is said to complement the common law rather than replace it."	"Sarah, a young professional, had been working at XYZ Corporation for three years when her boss, Michael, announced that her job was no longer needed due to company restructuring. Sarah was devastated and felt that she was being unfairly let go.

As she began exploring her options for an unfair dismissal claim, she discovered that Michael was not only her boss, but also her ex-boyfriend's brother. In fact, Michael had been the one to give her the referral that led to her job at XYZ Corporation in the first place.

Sarah was shocked and felt that Michael's personal relationship with her ex-boyfriend created a clear conflict of interest. She felt that Michael would not be impartial in making the decision to dismiss her. In fact, she suspected that he might have been influenced by his own biases.

Sarah feared that a fair hearing, according to the principles of natural justice, had not been provided to her. She felt that her right to a fair hearing, as guaranteed by the law, had been compromised. If her claim went ahead, she would argue that Michael's personal connection to her ex-boyfriend created an apparent bias, which would render the decision to dismiss her unfair and potentially void.

Through this scenario, we see the application of the principle of natural justice, which emphasizes the need for impartiality and fairness in decision-making processes. In this case, Michael's personal connection to Sarah's ex-boyfriend raised concerns about his ability to make an impartial decision, affecting Sarah's rights and legitimate expectations."
Natural rights and legal rights	"Some philosophers distinguish two types of rights, natural rights and legal rights.

Natural rights are those that are not dependent on the laws or customs of any particular culture or government, and so are universal, fundamental and inalienable (they cannot be repealed by human laws, though one can forfeit their enjoyment through one's actions, such as by violating someone else's rights). Natural law is the law of natural rights.
Legal rights are those bestowed onto a person by a given legal system (they can be modified, repealed, and restrained by human laws). The concept of positive law is related to the concept of legal rights.
Natural law first appeared in ancient Greek philosophy, and was referred to by Roman philosopher Cicero. It was subsequently alluded to in the Bible, and then developed in the Middle Ages by Catholic philosophers such as Albert the Great, his pupil Thomas Aquinas, and Jean Gerson in his 1402 work ""De Vita Spirituali Animae."" During the Age of Enlightenment, the concept of natural laws was used to challenge the divine right of kings, and became an alternative justification for the establishment of a social contract, positive law, and government – and thus legal rights – in the form of classical republicanism. Conversely, the concept of natural rights is used by others to challenge the legitimacy of all such establishments.
The idea of human rights derives from theories of natural rights. Those rejecting a distinction between human rights and natural rights view human rights as the successor that is not dependent on natural law, natural theology, or Christian theological doctrine. Natural rights, in particular, are considered beyond the authority of any government or international body to dismiss. The 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights is an important legal instrument enshrining one conception of natural rights into international soft law. Natural rights were traditionally viewed as exclusively negative rights, whereas human rights also comprise positive rights. Even on a natural rights conception of human rights, the two terms may not be synonymous.
The concept of natural rights is not universally accepted, partly due to its religious associations and perceived incoherence. Some philosophers argue that natural rights do not exist and that legal rights are the only rights; for instance, Jeremy Bentham called natural rights ""simple nonsense"". Iusnaturalism, particularly, holds that legal norms follow a human universal knowledge. Thus, it views enacted laws that contradict such universal knowledge as unjust and illegitimate, but some jusnaturalists might attribute the source of natural law to a natural order instead of a divine mandate."	"The small town of Willow Creek was known for its strong sense of community and respect for individual freedom. Emily, a young entrepreneur, had always dreamed of opening her own bakery. She finally saved up enough money and decided to take the plunge, renting a small shop on Main Street.

As she began to set up her bakery, Emily discovered that the town's zoning laws prohibited food businesses in the area. The mayor, Mrs. Johnson, explained that the laws were in place to maintain the town's aesthetic appeal and protect the local residents from what she deemed ""unsavory"" businesses.

Emily felt her natural right to pursue her passion and provide for herself being challenged. She argued that her bakery would bring joy and employment to the community, not harm. Mrs. Johnson countered that the town's laws took precedence over individual rights.

As the dispute escalated, Emily and Mrs. Johnson sought the help of local lawyers. Emily's lawyer, citing the concept of natural rights, argued that Emily's right to pursue her dreams and livelihood was inherent and universal, not dependent on the town's laws. The lawyer for Mrs. Johnson countered that the town's laws were reasonable and necessary to maintain public order.

The case ultimately ended up in court, where the judge deliberated on the balance between natural rights and legal rights. In the end, the judge ruled in Emily's favor, citing the town's duty to respect individuals' fundamental rights to pursue happiness and livelihood. The ruling allowed Emily to open her bakery, which became a beloved landmark in Willow Creek. The dispute highlighted the intersection of natural rights and legal rights, illustrating that while laws can shape our lives, they must also recognize and protect our fundamental human rights."
Necessity (criminal law)	"In the criminal law of many nations, necessity may be either a possible justification or an exculpation for breaking the law. Defendants seeking to rely on this defense argue that they should not be held liable for their actions as a crime because their conduct was necessary to prevent some greater harm and when that conduct is not excused under some other more specific provision of law such as self defense. As a matter of political expediency, states usually allow some classes of person to be excused from liability when they are engaged in socially useful functions but intentionally cause injury, loss or damage. 
For example, drunk drivers might contend that they drove their car to get away from being kidnapped (cf. North by Northwest).  Most common law and civil law jurisdictions recognize this defense, but only under limited circumstances. Generally, the defendant must affirmatively show (i.e., introduce some evidence) that (a) the harm they sought to avoid outweighs the danger of the prohibited conduct they are charged with; (b) they had no reasonable alternative; (c) they ceased to engage in the prohibited conduct as soon as the danger passed; and (d) they themselves did not create the danger they sought to avoid.  Thus, with the ""drunk driver"" example cited above, the necessity defense will not be recognized if the defendant drove further than was reasonably necessary to get away from the kidnapper, or if some other reasonable alternative was available to them.
For another example, the fire services and other civil defence organizations have a general duty to keep the community safe from harm. If a fire or flood is threatening to spread out of control, it may be reasonably necessary to destroy other property to form a fire break, or to trespass on land to throw up mounds of earth to prevent the water from spreading. 
These examples have the common feature of individuals intentionally breaking the law because they believe it to be urgently necessary to protect others from harm, but some states distinguish between a response to a crisis arising from an entirely natural cause (an inanimate force of nature), e.g. a fire from a lightning strike or rain from a storm, and a response to an entirely human crisis. Thus, parents who lack the financial means to feed their children cannot use necessity as a defense if they steal food. The existence of welfare benefits and strategies other than self-help defeat the claim of an urgent necessity that cannot be avoided in any way other than by breaking the law. 
Further, some states apply a test of proportionality, where the defense would only be allowed where the degree of harm actually caused was a reasonably proportionate response to the degree of harm threatened. This is a legal form of cost–benefit analysis."	"As the wildfire raged toward the residential neighborhood, firefighter Jack knew he had to act fast. The flames were out of control, and if he didn't do something, the entire town would be lost. Jack quickly surveyed the area and spotted a small opening between the houses. He knew if he could create a fire break by destroying a small section of the nearby park, he could buy the town some time to evacuate.

Jack hesitated for a moment, thinking about the law. Fire departments were required to follow certain protocols, and breaking into a public park was definitely against the rules. But he knew it was necessary to prevent a greater harm. With a heavy heart, Jack took out his radio and called for backup.

As he began to set the park on fire, he was filled with anxiety. Was he doing the right thing? Would he be held accountable for breaking the law? Jack knew that if anyone saw him, they would likely report him, and he could face charges.

But Jack didn't let his fears deter him. He worked quickly and efficiently, creating a fire break that would give the town the time they needed to escape. As he finished, he heard the sound of sirens in the distance, and the fire department arrived on the scene.

When the investigation came, Jack explained his actions, citing necessity as his defense. After reviewing the evidence, the prosecutor determined that Jack had acted reasonably, and his actions indeed saved the town from certain destruction. Jack was never charged, and his actions were praised by the community for their bravery and selflessness.

This story illustrates the concept of necessity in criminal law. Jack broke the law, but in a situation where the harm he sought to avoid (losing the town) outweighed the danger of his actions (breaking into the park). He had no reasonable alternative, and he ceased his actions as soon as the danger passed."
Negligence	"Negligence (Lat. negligentia) is a failure to exercise appropriate care expected to be exercised in similar circumstances. 
Within the scope of tort law, negligence pertains to harm caused by the violation of a duty of care through a negligent act or failure to act. The concept of negligence is linked to the obligation of individuals to exercise reasonable care in their actions and to consider foreseeable harm that their conduct might cause to other people or property. The elements of a negligence claim include the duty to act or refrain from action, breach of that duty, actual and proximate cause of harm, and damages. Someone who suffers loss caused by another's negligence may be able to sue for damages to compensate for their harm. Such loss may include physical injury, harm to property, psychiatric illness, or economic loss."	"As the sun rose over the small town of Willow Creek, Maria prepared for her daily jog on the local trail. She had done it many times before, and the path was well-lit and popular among locals. However, this particular morning, Maria noticed that the trail was covered in leaves and didn't see any maintenance workers setting up barriers or signs to alert runners.

As she rounded a bend, Maria's feet suddenly flew out from under her on a slippery patch of leaves. She landed hard on her elbow, breaking her radius bone. The pain was excruciating, and Maria lay there, unable to move or think clearly.

It soon became clear that the town's parks department had failed to clear the trail of leaves, despite having been notified about the issue by several residents. The department's routine maintenance schedule had been disrupted, and no one had checked the trail before Maria's jog.

Maria was left with a long rehabilitation process and significant medical bills. She decided to file a lawsuit against the town's parks department, alleging negligence in their failure to maintain the trail and failing to alert runners of the potential hazard.

In this scenario, the town's parks department had a duty to maintain the trail in a safe condition. By breaching that duty and failing to clear the leaves, they caused Maria's harm. The trail department's negligence was the direct cause of Maria's injury, and she suffered significant damages as a result."
Nemo iudex in causa sua	"Nemo judex in causa sua (IPA: [ˈne.mo ˈju.dɛks in ˈkau̯.sa ˈsua]; also written as nemo [est] judex in sua causa, in propria causa, in re sua or in parte sua) is a Latin brocard that translates as ""no one is judge in his own case"". Originating from Roman law, it was crystallized into a phrase by Edward Coke in the 17th century and is now widely regarded as a fundamental tenet of natural justice and constitutionalism. It states that no one can judge a case in which they have an interest. In some jurisdictions, the principle is strictly enforced to avoid any appearance of bias, even when there is none: as Lord Chief Justice Hewart laid down in Rex v. Sussex Justices, ""Justice must not only be done, but must also be seen to be done""."	"Emma, a successful businesswoman, had been in a heated dispute with her former business partner, Tom, over the ownership of their web development company. After a year of disagreements, the partnership was dissolved, and the case was headed to mediation. Emma was confident that she had all the evidence on her side and was determined to prove that she deserved full ownership of the company.

As the mediator, David, began the process, Emma was surprised to find that Tom was being represented by his own lawyer, Rachel. Emma felt a sense of unease, as she knew Rachel from her student days when they had studied law together. Emma couldn't shake off the feeling that Rachel was biased in favor of Tom, simply because of their shared past.

As the mediation progressed, Emma struggled to focus on the merits of her case, as she couldn't help but wonder if Rachel was more concerned about helping her own friend than ensuring a fair outcome. She began to feel frustrated and unheard, and eventually, the mediation was abandoned due to Emma's inability to continue participating.

The judge, upon reviewing the case, ruled that the mediation process was compromised by Emma's perception of bias. The case was reassigned to a new mediator, and the dispute ultimately ended in a settlement. In this scenario, Emma was unable to act as her own judge and advocate due to the perception of biased representation. The principle of ""Nemo judex in causa sua"" ensured that justice was not only done but also seen to be done, as the original mediation was deemed unfair and ultimately led to a new outcome."
Nolle prosequi	"Nolle prosequi, abbreviated nol or nolle pros, is legal Latin meaning ""to be unwilling to pursue"". It is a type of prosecutorial discretion in common law, used for prosecutors' declarations that they are voluntarily ending a criminal case before trial or before a verdict is rendered; it is a kind of motion to dismiss and contrasts with an involuntary dismissal."	"It was a typical Monday morning at the police station when Officer Jameson met with District Attorney, Emily Wilson, to discuss the upcoming trial of John Smith, accused of burglary. Emily had been reviewing the case files and was no longer convinced of the strength of their evidence. She believed that without further investigation, they wouldn't be able to prove John's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

As they reviewed the case, Emily realized that the prosecution's key witness was no longer cooperating, and the physical evidence they had gathered was weak. Emily decided that it would be futile to proceed with the trial. She explained her concerns to Officer Jameson and suggested they file a motion to dismiss the case.

Officer Jameson agreed, and together they drafted a motion citing the lack of strong evidence and their decision to exercise ""nolle prosequi"". This legal term allows the prosecution to voluntarily drop a case, rather than an involuntary dismissal triggered by court order or a mishap.

The court granted their motion, and the case was officially dismissed. John Smith walked out of the courtroom a free man, grateful for the decision yet a bit bewildered by the sudden turn of events. Emily and Officer Jameson understood that their decision to drop the case wasn't a reflection on John's guilt or innocence, but rather a smart and fair decision given the circumstances."
Nominative use	"Nominative use, also ""nominative fair use"", is a legal doctrine that provides an affirmative defense to trademark infringement as enunciated by the United States Ninth Circuit, by which a person may use the trademark of another as a reference to describe the other product, or to compare it to their own. Nominative use may be considered to be either related to, or a type of ""trademark fair use"" (sometimes called ""classic fair use"" or ""statutory fair use"").  All ""trademark fair use"" doctrines, however classified, are distinct from the fair use doctrine in copyright law.  However, the fair use of a trademark may be protected under copyright laws depending on the complexity or creativity of the mark as a design logo.
The nominative use test essentially states that one party may use or refer to the trademark of another if:

The product or service cannot be readily identified without using the trademark (e.g. trademark is descriptive of a person, place, or product attribute).
The user only uses as much of the mark as is necessary for the identification (e.g. the words but not the font or symbol).
The user does nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.  This applies even if the nominative use is commercial, and the same test applies to metatags.
Furthermore, if a use is found to be nominative, then by the definition of non-trademark uses, it can not dilute the trademark.
Nominative use does not require that ownership of the trademark be acknowledged, for example by use of a sentence such as ""UNIX is a registered trademark of The Open Group"". Such statements may, however, be required by the terms of a license agreement between the parties, and they may be prudent (and courteous) as a way of preventing misunderstandings or allegations of passing off."	"The coffee shop scene was bustling with activity. Emma, a freelance food blogger, was scribbling away in her notebook, trying to come up with the perfect phrase to describe the taste of the new, highly-anticipated latte from popular coffee chain, ""The Daily Grind"". As she took a sip, her eyes scanned the menu board, and she was struck by the bold, signature font and logo of the brand.

Undecided on which flavor to try, Emma turned to her friend, Steve, who was sitting across from her, typing away on his laptop. ""Have you tried the new latte from The Daily Grind?"" Emma asked. ""What's it like?"" Steve looked up, took a sip, and began raving about the flavors and texture.

Emma's eyes lit up, and she quickly jotted down some notes in her notebook. As she packed up to leave, she turned to Steve and said, ""I need to blog about this new latte. I'll call the review 'The Daily Grind's Latest Creation: A Beverage to Sip Away Your Worries'.""

In this scenario, Emma's use of the words ""The Daily Grind"" is considered nominative use. She is using the trademark solely to identify the brand of coffee and distinguish it from other brands, allowing readers to understand what she is talking about. She is not using the trademark in a way that is likely to confuse consumers or suggest sponsorship or endorsement from the brand. In fact, her use is solely for descriptive and informative purposes, providing a legitimate and useful comparison to other coffee brands."
Non bis in idem	"Non bis in idem (sometimes rendered non-bis in idem or ne bis in idem), which translates literally from Latin as 'not twice in the same [thing]', is a legal doctrine to the effect that no legal action can be instituted twice for the same cause of action. It is a legal concept originating in Roman civil law, but it is essentially the equivalent of the double jeopardy doctrine found in common law jurisdictions, and similar peremptory plea (autrefois acquit/convict, 'previously acquitted/convicted') in some modern civil law countries.
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guarantees the right to be free from double jeopardy; however, it does not apply to prosecutions by two different sovereigns (unless the relevant extradition treaty or other agreement between the countries expresses a prohibition). The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court employs a modified form of non bis in idem."	"Meet Sarah, a successful businesswoman who owns a small boutique in downtown Los Angeles. In 2018, Sarah was accused of embezzling funds from a former business partner, John. She was charged with fraud and pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of misappropriation of funds. As part of her plea deal, Sarah agreed to pay a fine and perform community service.

Two years later, John, who had been unsatisfied with the outcome of the original case, brought new charges against Sarah, claiming that she had committed fraud and money laundering. The new charges were based on the same alleged actions that had led to the initial plea deal.

Sarah's lawyer argued that the new charges violated the principle of non bis in idem, as she had already been punished for the same actions in the earlier case. The court agreed, ruling that the new charges were barred because they were based on the same facts and could result in Sarah facing double punishment.

The court dismissed the new charges, and Sarah was finally able to put the ordeal behind her. The story illustrates the concept of non bis in idem, which ensures that individuals are not punished twice for the same alleged wrongdoing. In this case, Sarah had already faces the consequences of her actions once, and it would be unjust to punish her again."
Non prosequitur	"Non prosequitur (also known as non pros.) is a legal judgment ""against the plaintiff for a neglect to take any of those steps which it is incumbent on him to take in due time."" A non pros judgment is a final judgment, which is only re-opened with cause shown."	"Here's a story that illustrates the legal concept of non prosequitur:

Imagine a small business owner, Rachel, who owns a bakery in a quiet town. She sues her former landlord, Jack, for $10,000 in damages, claiming that he didn't maintain the building properly, resulting in a mold infestation that destroyed much of her products and equipment. Rachel files a lawsuit and serves Jack with a complaint.

However, over the next six months, Rachel fails to take any further action in the lawsuit. She doesn't file any motions, answer Jack's interrogatories, or participate in discovery. She doesn't even bother to check in with the court to confirm that the case is still pending.

Meanwhile, Jack sends Rachel multiple requests to prove her claims and provide evidence, but Rachel ignores them. The court sends Rachel a letter reminding her of the impending deadline to file a response, but she doesn't respond.

After a year has passed, the court issues a final judgment in favor of Jack, ruling that Rachel had failed to take any steps to prosecute her claim. The court thus declares that the lawsuit is abandoned, and Rachel is hereby non-suited or ""non-pros"" from prosecuting any further claims. This means that Rachel's claims are now barred, and she can't revive the lawsuit without showing good cause for the delay.

As a result, Rachel is out of luck, and the court's award is against her. She lost the opportunity to pursue her claims due to her own neglect and inaction, exemplifying the concept of non prosequitur."
Nonacquiescence	In law, nonacquiescence is the intentional failure by one branch of the government to comply with the decision of another to some degree.  It tends to arise only in governments that feature a strong separation of powers, such as in the United States, and is much rarer in governments where such powers are partly or wholly fused. Nonacquiescence may lead to a constitutional crisis, given certain critical situations and decisions.	"In the United States, the separation of powers has long been a cornerstone of the system of government. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches are designed to balance and check each other's authority, ensuring that no one branch dominates the others. This delicate dance of power is often put to the test, and no more so than when one branch refuses to comply with a decision made by another.

In the small town of Willow Creek, the local Judge, Jane Smith, ruled that the town's mayor, Robert Johnson, was in violation of the town charter by appointing a new town manager without first consulting the town council. Judge Smith ordered the mayor to rescind the appointment and to work with the council to find a new candidate.

However, instead of complying with the Judge's order, Mayor Johnson decided to put forward the same candidate for town manager again, claiming that he had consulted with the council this time and that the appointment was still within the bounds of the charter. The town council, feeling disrespected by the mayor's actions, refused to confirm the appointment, effectively blocking it from moving forward.

This scenario illustrates the concept of nonacquiescence, where one branch of government, in this case the executive, intentionally chose not to comply with a decision made by another branch, the judicial. The mayor's actions may lead to a constitutional crisis in Willow Creek, and may ultimately end in a standoff between the three branches. In such situations, finding a resolution can be challenging, but it is essential to preserve the balance of power and maintain the integrity of the system."
Nondelegation doctrine	"The doctrine of nondelegation (or non-delegation principle) is the theory that one branch of government must not authorize another entity to exercise the power or function which it is constitutionally authorized to exercise itself. It is explicit or implicit in all written constitutions that impose a strict structural separation of powers. It is usually applied in questions of constitutionally improper delegations of powers of any of the three branches of government to either of the other, to the administrative state, or to private entities. Although it is usually constitutional for executive officials to delegate executive powers to executive branch subordinates, there can also be improper delegations of powers within an executive branch.
In the United Kingdom, the non-delegation principle refers to the prima facie presumption that statutory powers granted to public bodies by Parliament cannot be delegated to other people or bodies."	"In the small town of Willow Creek, the city council had been struggling to deal with the increasing number of noise complaints from residents. To address the issue, the council members decided to pass an ordinance granting the mayor the power to create and enforce noise restrictions.

The ordinance stated that the mayor would be responsible for determining what constituted excessive noise and would have the authority to impose fines on violators. While the council members thought this would be a more effective solution than having to deal with individual complaints themselves, they didn't specify how the mayor would make these decisions or what criteria she would use to determine what was considered excessive noise.

As time went on, residents began to feel that the mayor was not using her discretion fairly, and that certain noise levels were being enforced arbitrarily. A local business owner, Sarah, who owned a music venue that was popular among students, decided to take action. She argued that the mayor's power to decide what was excessive noise without specific guidelines was an unlawful delegation of power, as it was not explicitly stated in the ordinance.

Sarah's case went all the way to the state supreme court, which ultimately ruled in her favor. The court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it violated the nondelegation doctrine. The city council had given the mayor too much discretion and failed to provide clear guidelines for making decisions, which allowed her to exercise powers that were constitutionally intended for the judiciary or legislative branches. The court held that the ordinance needed to be rewritten to provide specific standards for determining excessive noise."
Notice of violation (US)	Notices of violation are issued from Code Enforcement by local cities or towns when properties may be contrary to local codes and regulation, vehicles are substandard, inoperable or may have constituted a public nuisance. The ordinances under which violation notices or statements are performed vary from one country to another and between cities within a country or states.	"The small town of Oakdale was known for its charm and character, but its residents took pride in maintaining their properties to meet the town's strict building codes. That is, except for the Smiths, who had been living in the same old house for decades.

As the years went by, the house had fallen into disrepair, with overgrown weeds, broken shutters, and a patchwork of peeling paint. The once-peaceful neighborhood was now a source of concern for the town officials, who had received numerous complaints about the Smiths' property.

One day, the Smiths received a Notice of Violation from the Code Enforcement office, citing multiple code violations and ordering them to correct the issues within a specific timeframe. The notice specified the exact changes needed, from trimming the overgrown trees to repairing the crooked shutters.

The Smiths were taken aback, feeling as though they had been singled out unfairly. However, they soon realized that the notice was not a condemnation, but rather a constructive effort to bring their property into compliance with the town's codes. With some inconvenience, they set to work, making the necessary repairs and renovations.

In the end, the Smiths' property was transformed, and their neighborhood was once again a source of pride for Oakdale's residents. The Notice of Violation had served as a catalyst for change, reminding everyone of the importance of maintaining property standards and community pride."
Nulla poena sine culpa	"Nulla poena sine culpa (Latin for ""no punishment without fault"" or ""no punishment without culpability"") or the guilt principle is a legal principle requiring that one cannot be punished for something that they are not guilty of. It is recognized as a human right by the Court of Justice of the European Union and all Council of Europe member states. Under this principle, a person can not be punished if he or she is not guilty. Cases of force majeure or necessity are exempted from criminal responsibility. Furthermore, it establishes that no one can be liable for the crimes committed by another person."	"Professor Maria Thompson, a renowned expert in medieval history, was on her way to a conference in Paris when her flight was suddenly diverted due to a severe thunderstorm. Despite her protests, the pilot had to make an emergency landing in a nearby airport, causing her luggage to be lost or damaged beyond recognition.

As she arrived at the conference center, frazzled and disheveled, she discovered that she had misplaced her presentation notes and had to start from scratch. The conference organizer, Mrs. Johnson, sternly informed her that her tardiness and lack of preparedness would negatively impact her chances of securing a grant for her research.

Maria felt devastated, but soon realized that Mrs. Johnson was mistaken. The force majeure (uncontrollable circumstances) of the thunderstorm, combined with a series of unfortunate events, had led to Maria's woes. She hadn't done anything wrong, but was still being held accountable.

Mark, a seasoned lawyer, witnessed the scene and intervened, citing the principle of Nulla poena sine culpa. He explained that Maria couldn't be punished for something beyond her control. Maria's colleague, Dr. Patel, supported Mark's argument, recalling a similar incident where his research equipment was damaged due to a faulty gyroscope.

The conference organizer apologized and offered Maria an extension, citing the principle of fairness and the importance of recognizing the impact of unforeseen circumstances on one's actions. Maria's grant proposal was eventually accepted, and she went on to receive positive feedback from her peers for her resilience and quick thinking in the face of adversity."
Nulla poena sine lege	"Nulla poena sine lege (Latin for ""no penalty without law"", Anglicized pronunciation:  NUL-ə PEE-nə SY-nee LEE-jee) is a legal formula which, in its narrow interpretation, states that one can only be punished for doing something if a penalty for this behavior is fixed in criminal law. As some laws are unwritten (e.g. in oral law or customary law) and laws can be interpreted broadly, it does not necessarily mean that an action will not be punished simply because a specific rule against it is not codified.
The variant nullum crimen sine lege (""no crime without law"") establishes that conduct is not criminal if not found among the behavior/circumstance combinations of a statute. The other interpretations of the formula include the rules prohibiting retroactive criminalization and prescribing laws to be strictly construed.
Despite the use of Latin language and brocard-like appearance, the formula was mostly born in 18th century liberalism (some elements of non-retroactivity of laws and limiting the punishment to the one prescribed in the statute date back to Roman times). This principle is accepted and codified in modern democratic states as a basic requirement of the rule of law. It has been described as ""one of the most 'widely held value-judgement[s] in the entire history of human thought'"".

"	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of ""Nulla poena sine lege"":

Meet Emma, a freelance journalist living in a bustling metropolis. She loves nothing more than sniffing out scoops and uncovering government corruption. One day, while investigating a local development project, she stumbles upon a tip that suggests a certain councilor has been taking bribes from contractors.

Without hesitation, Emma decides to expose the story, writing a scathing article that goes viral. The councilor, however, takes umbrage with the expose and decides to sue Emma for libel. But here's the thing: there is no specific law that criminalizes defamation in the city's legal code.

The councilor demands that Emma be charged and punished for her ""crimes."" But Emma's lawyer argues that under the principle of ""Nulla poena sine lege,"" the councilor can't simply make up a law as they go along and punish Emma for something not even illegal. The court agrees, ruling that since there is no law explicitly prohibiting the publication of defamatory statements, Emma can't be held accountable for something that isn't criminal.

This ruling protects not only Emma's freedom of speech but also the integrity of the legal system. The principle ensures that people can't be punished without explicit and clear laws governing their behavior, preventing arbitrary and unjust punishment. In this case, the court's decision upholds the basic right to free expression and criticism, safeguarding a cornerstone of democracy.

This scenario illustrates how ""Nulla poena sine lege"" applies in real life, highlighting the importance of clear and explicit laws to prevent arbitrary punishment and uphold the rule of law."
Nuremberg principles	"The Nuremberg principles are a set of guidelines for determining what constitutes a war crime. The document was created by the International Law Commission of the United Nations to codify the legal principles underlying the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi party members following World War II.

"	"**The Case of Maria, the Battalion Commander**

It was 2006 and Maria, a high-ranking officer in a paramilitary battalion in a small country, had been tasked with putting down a local rebellion in a rural area. After several days of armed clashes, her unit had engaged in what they called ""targeted killings"" of suspected rebels, resulting in over a dozen civilian casualties.

Maria's battalion leadership assured her that the indiscriminate killings were justified as a necessary response to the ""ticking time bomb"" situation. They claimed that their actions had minimized civilian losses and that Maria had acted on legitimate orders.

However, a UN investigation later revealed that the battalion had falsified records, covered up the number of civilian deaths, and traded sympathies with neighboring countries who had provided the paramilitary group with military equipment. The investigators also discovered that Maria had been personally ordered by the battalion's commander to execute at least two journalists who had been covering the conflict.

The investigation applied the Nuremberg principles, which emphasize that individuals can be held responsible for their actions, even if they could be seen as following orders from a commanding officer, if those actions amount to a war crime. The Nuremberg principles emphasize individual criminal responsibility, meaning that individuals who commit international humanitarian law violations can be held liable for their part in the crime.

Maria's story stands as an example of the war crimes codified within the Nuremberg principles. While she could argue that she followed orders from her commanding officer, the principles dictate that she would still be held accountable for her actions, including killing the journalists and conducting the indiscriminate killings, regardless of any military orders that may have been given."
Obiter dictum	"Obiter dictum (usually used in the plural, obiter dicta) is a Latin phrase meaning ""said in passing"", that is, any remark in a legal opinion that is ""said in passing"" by a judge or arbitrator. It is a concept derived from English common law, whereby a judgment comprises only two elements: ratio decidendi and obiter dicta. For the purposes of judicial precedent, ratio decidendi is binding, whereas obiter dicta are persuasive only."	"It was a crisp autumn morning when Rachel, a determined entrepreneur, walked into Judge Thompson's courtroom. Her small business, Bake & Smile, was at the center of a bitter dispute with a former supplier, Patrick's Pastries. Rachel accused Patrick's Pastries of breaching their contract by suddenly raising prices without notice, causing Rachel to incur significant losses.

After hearing both sides, Judge Thompson delivered her judgment: ""The contract between Bake & Smile and Patrick's Pastries does not have a clear clause regarding price changes. Therefore, I rule in favor of Bake & Smile, ordering Patrick's Pastries to refund the excess payment.""

As Rachel beamed with joy, Judge Thompson continued, ""However, I must caution future businesses to include such provisions in their contracts to avoid similar disputes. Judges should not be forced to make arbitrary decisions without clear guidelines."" This additional remark, while insightful, was not binding and didn't directly affect the outcome of the case.

Rachel's lawyer, Tim, whispered to her, ""That's an excellent example of obiter dictum, Rachel. The judge's comment about judges not making arbitrary decisions was just a passing remark, not essential to the ruling. Obiter dictum is like a judge's musings, adding value but not legally binding."" Rachel nodded, grateful for this new understanding of the legal concept. As she left the courtroom, she realized that in her own business dealings, including clear contract language would help avoid disputes in the future.

This passing remark, though not critical to the judgment, became a valuable lesson for Rachel and her fellow entrepreneurs, illustrating the importance of obiter dictum in the legal system."
Odious debt	In international law, odious debt, also known as illegitimate debt, is a legal theory that says that the national debt incurred by a despotic regime should not be enforceable. Such debts are, thus, considered by this doctrine to be personal debts of the government that incurred them and not debts of the state. In some respects, the concept is analogous to the invalidity of contracts signed under coercion. Whether or not it is possible to discharge debts in this manner is a matter of dispute.	"**The Tale of Marcello and the Rogue Regime**

In the small island nation of Azuria, Marcello, a wealthy businessman, had managed to build a thriving business empire. However, the country was under the grip of a ruthless dictator, President Rodriguez, who had amassed a significant portion of the national debt. As part of his regime's financial tactics, President Rodriguez had forced Marcello to lend Azuria's government billions of dollars at exorbitant interest rates to fund his lavish lifestyle and other pet projects.

When the year was up, the new democratically-elected government, led by the cartel-backed Constance Rodriguez, refused to assume the odious debt. She argued that the loans were unconstitutional and should be declared null and void. Marcello was not surprised.

**Main scenario:**-Marcello doing tatprotax overturn law stor最終ylabilirI'm happy to rewrite the story to make it clear and concise:

**The Tale of Marcello and the Rogue Regime**

In the small island nation of Azuria, Marcello, a wealthy businessman, had managed to build a thriving business empire. However, the country was under the grip of a ruthless dictator, President Rodriguez, who had amassed a significant portion of the national debt. As part of his regime's financial tactics, President Rodriguez had forced Marcello to lend Azuria's government billions of dollars at exorbitant interest rates to fund his lavish lifestyle and other pet projects.

But the new democratically-elected government, under Constance Rodriguez (President Rodriguez's niece), refused to assume the debt, arguing that it was odious and should be declared null and void. Marcello was not surprised.

The new government claimed that the debts were incurred by the dictatorship for personal gain, and not for the benefit of the country. They maintained that a democratic government should not be held accountable for the debts of an authoritarian regime. Marcello had legitimate expectations of repayment, but the new government was unwilling to honor them, leaving him to negotiate a new deal or seek compensation.

In this scenario, the debt is considered odious because it was taken on by a corrupt and oppressive government for its own benefit, rather than for the good of the people or country. This case raises questions about the responsibility of a democratic government to honor the debts of its predecessors, and highlights the complexities of international law and the concept of odious debt."
Open court principle	"The open court principle requires that court proceedings presumptively be open and accessible to the public and to the media.
In contrast, in camera describes court proceedings where the public and press are not allowed to observe the procedure or process."	"It was a typical Monday morning at the city courthouse. Sarah, a young journalist, was waiting outside courtroom B, eager to cover the trial of the day. She had been following the case of a local businessman accused of embezzlement and was determined to get the scoop.

As she waited, she noticed a group of family members of the accused gathered outside, some looking nervous and others anxious. Sarah struck up a conversation with them, asking about their expectations for the trial.

Inside the courtroom, the judge called the case to order and the prosecutor began to present its case. Sarah slipped inside just as the judge reminded everyone that the courtroom was open to the public and that the media was welcome to attend.

As the trial progressed, Sarah took notes and snapped photos, capturing the reactions of the family members and the tense atmosphere in the courtroom. The proceedings were open and transparent, allowing everyone present to witness the evidence being presented and the arguments being made.

However, later that afternoon, the judge called a recess and adjourned the trial to a private room. The courtroom was cleared, and the public and press were ordered to leave. Sarah was confused but understood that this was the judge's discretion to hold an in-camera session. She waited outside, reporting on the earlier proceeding and speculating about what might have transpired in the private meeting. The open court principle had allowed her to exercise her role as a journalist, while also respecting the judge's authority to ensure a fair trial."
Open-fields doctrine	"The open-fields doctrine (also open-field doctrine or open-fields rule), in the U.S. law of criminal procedure, is the legal doctrine that a ""warrantless search of the area outside a property owner's curtilage"" does not violate the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, ""unless there is some other legal basis for the search,"" such a search ""must exclude the home and any adjoining land (such as a yard) that is within an enclosure or otherwise protected from public scrutiny."""	"Tom had been reporting suspicious activity to the police for weeks. He lived in a small community with a few houses and a large open field in the center. Every evening, he'd see strange people lurking around the perimeter of the field, sometimes with backpacks and strange equipment. Tom was concerned something illegal was going on, but he couldn't see into the field itself.

One evening, Tom called the police again, and they arrived quickly. They asked Tom if he had any information about the suspicious activity, and he pointed out the people in the field. The officers went to the field and found a large stash of contraband drugs and illegal equipment.

Tom wondered if the police had done something wrong by searching the field without a warrant. But when he asked his lawyer, she explained that the open-fields doctrine applies in situations like this. Since the field is not enclosed or protected by some kind of fence or other structure, it's considered a public area, and the police didn't need a warrant to search it.

In contrast, if the police had searched Tom's property or the property of the people living next door, they would have needed a warrant. The curtilage, or the area around a home, is protected by the Fourth Amendment, which prevents unreasonable searches and seizures. But the open field beyond the houses is fair game, as long as the search is done in a way that's reasonable and not targeting a specific individual.

Tom felt relieved to know that the search was legal, and the police were able to find and prosecute those involved in the illegal activity. He was grateful that his community was safer, and he was appreciative of the open-fields doctrine, which allowed the police to keep his community safe without violating anyone's constitutional rights."
Open justice	"Open justice is a legal principle that requires that judicial proceedings be conducted in a transparent manner and with the oversight of the people, so as to safeguard the rights of those subject to the power of the court and to allow for the scrutiny of the public in general. The term has particular emphasis in legal systems based on British law, such as in the United Kingdom, Commonwealth countries such as South Africa and Canada and Australia, and former British colonies such as the United States. The term has several closely related meanings: it is seen as a fundamental right guaranteeing liberty; it describes guidelines for how courts can be more transparent; and it sometimes identifies an ideal situation. In a courtroom, it means steps to promote transparency such as letting the public see and hear trials as they happen in real time, televising trials as they happen, videotaping proceedings for later viewing, publishing the content and documents of court files, providing transcripts of statements, making past decisions available for review in an easy-to-access format, publishing decisions, and giving reporters full access to files and participants so they can report what happens. The principle includes efforts to try to make what happens in the court understandable to the public and the press.
In Canada, open justice is referred to as the open court principle."	"It was a chilly winter morning when Sarah, a local journalist, received a phone call from the courthouse about an upcoming trial. The court was set to hear a high-profile case involving a allegations of police brutality against a young black man, Jamal. The story had already gained significant attention in the community, with many residents expressing outrage and disbelief at the accusations.

Sarah was determined to get the scoop on the story, but when she arrived at the courthouse, she was surprised to find that the courtroom was packed not only with curious onlookers but also with local leaders and community representatives. The judge, recognizing the importance of transparency in this sensitive case, had taken steps to ensure that the proceedings were open to the public.

As the trial began, Sarah and her colleagues were given full access to the courtroom, allowing them to live-stream the proceedings on their social media platforms. The community was glued to their screens, following along as the evidence was presented and the witnesses testified.

Throughout the trial, the courtroom was filled with chatter as onlookers discussed the case and shared their reactions with one another. The judge and lawyers were more than happy to answer the public's questions, and the courtroom became a hub for community engagement and debate.

In the end, the trial resulted in a guilty verdict, and Sarah's report was hailed as one of the most detailed and accurate coverage of the case. The open justice principle had allowed the community to be a part of the process, fostering trust and transparency in a time of great uncertainty."
Open mines doctrine	"The open mines doctrine is a term of real property. Under the open mines doctrine, depletion of natural resources constitutes waste unless consumption of such resources constitutes normal use of the land, as in the case of a life estate in coal mine or a granite quarry. 
The life tenant cannot open the land to search for minerals and other natural resources, but if the quarries or mines were open before the tenant took the life estate, then it is not waste for the life tenant to continue their use.  Where the life tenant opens the land for new mines (i.e., voluntary waste) a remainderman can enjoin such.
The sale of harvestable crops does not constitute waste, inasmuch as they can be regrown and are thus generally not considered “natural resources”."	"The small town of Oakdale had been home to the Smith family for generations. Robert Smith, a devoted uncle, had taken a life estate in the family's coal mine, which had been operational since the early 1900s. The mine had been a significant source of income for the family, providing coal for the town's residents and companies. However, over the years, the mine had gradually depleted, and Robert was starting to worry about its future.

One day, Robert's nephew, James, came to him with an idea to open a new mine and explore other natural resources, such as granite and copper, which he believed could generate even more revenue. However, Robert was hesitant, remembering his father's warnings about the importance of preserving the land for future generations.

A local lawyer advised Robert that under the open mines doctrine, as the life tenant, he had the right to continue using the land as it was previously used, but he could not open the land to search for new minerals and resources without permission from the remaindermen. If Robert went ahead and opened new mines without permission, the remaindermen could take legal action to enjoin him.

Robert decided to respect the family's legacy and tradition by preserving the land in its current state, rather than risking a legal dispute with his family. He continued to harvest the remaining coal, ensuring the town's coal needs were met while maintaining the family's property rights for generations to come."
Pacta sunt servanda	"Pacta sunt servanda (""agreements must be kept."") is a brocard and a fundamental principle of law which holds that treaties or contracts are binding upon the parties that entered into the treaty or contract. It is customary international law. According to Hans Wehberg, a professor of international law, ""few rules for the ordering of Society have such a deep moral and religious influence"" as this principle.
In its most common sense, the principle refers to private contracts and prescribes that the provisions, i.e. clauses, of a contract are law between the parties to the contract, and therefore implies that neglect of their respective obligations is a violation of the contract. The first known expression of the brocard is in the writings of the canonist Cardinal Hostiensis from the 13th century AD, which were published in the 16th."	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of ""Pacta sunt servanda"":

Sarah and Alex had been friends since college, and over the years, they had made plans to co-found a small bakery together. They both worked hard to raise startup funds and finally secured a small storefront in a bustling neighborhood. As they were about to sign the lease, they had a heart-to-heart about the partnership.

Sarah wanted to take the lead in managing the bakery's finances, while Alex wanted to focus on the cooking and product development. They agreed to share profits and expenses 50/50, as reflected in their partnership agreement. However, unspoken and unwritten, Sarah understood that Alex would be heavily involved in creative decisions, while Alex assumed Sarah would run the administrative side without much interference.

After several months of hard work, Alex decided to start serving salads and sandwiches, which weren't even mentioned in the partnership agreement. Sarah was taken aback when Alex claimed she had always been encouraged to experiment and expected her input on business decisions. But, Saran had assumed it was an informal agreement and not part of their binding contract.

When Alex introduced new product lines without consulting Sarah, she felt betrayed and felt her half of the profits were being spent without her input. She claimed that the partnership agreement was clear that only agreed-upon business decisions could be made, and Alex's actions were a breach of their contract. Disputes ensued, each one accusing the other of violating the partnership agreement.

It wasn't until both friends referred to their partnership agreement and realized that only they had made explicit plans when it came to finances, not menus.  The di"
Paraphrasing of copyrighted material	"Paraphrasing of copyrighted material may, under certain circumstances, constitute copyright infringement. In most countries that have national copyright laws, copyright applies to the original expression in a work rather than to the meanings or ideas being expressed. Whether a paraphrase is an infringement of expression, or a permissible restatement of an idea, is not a binary question but a matter of degree. Copyright law in common law countries tries to avoid theoretical discussion of the nature of ideas and expression such as this, taking a more pragmatic view of what is called the idea/expression dichotomy. The acceptable degree of difference between a prior work and a paraphrase depends on a variety of factors and ultimately depends on the judgement of the court in each individual case.

"	"As a young writer, Emily had always admired the literary genius of renowned author, James. She had devoured his bestselling novel, ""The Lost City"", and was particularly captivated by the vivid descriptions of the ancient civilization that it portrayed. Emily had since been working on her own novel, inspired by James' work, and was struggling to find the perfect way to describe the ruins of an abandoned city in her own story.

One day, while re-reading ""The Lost City"" for inspiration, Emily stumbled upon a passage that read: ""The crumbling stones told the tale of a once-great nation, their intricate carvings and hieroglyphics whispering secrets of a long-lost culture."" Emily was struck by the poetic language and, trying to add her own flair, she rewrote the sentence in her own words: ""The weathered facades of the city's ancient structures whispered tales of a long-forgotten people, their mysterious symbols and etchings holding the keys to a bygone era.""

While Emily thought she had successfully paraphrased James' idea, she wasn't sure if she had crossed the line into copyright infringement. Had she taken too much from James' original work, or had she merely restated the idea in her own voice? Consumed by uncertainty, Emily sought the advice of a lawyer, who ultimately advised her to consider the idea-expression dichotomy in copyright law: did her rewritten sentence express a new idea or simply copied James' original expression? The court would ultimately decide, but for now, Emily took a deep breath and continued writing, ever mindful of the delicate balance between inspiration and infringement."
Parker immunity doctrine	"The Parker immunity doctrine is an exemption from liability for engaging in antitrust violations.  It applies to the state when it exercises legislative authority in creating a regulation with anticompetitive effects, and to private actors when they act at the direction of the state after it has done so.  The doctrine is named for the Supreme Court of the United States case in which it was initially developed, Parker v. Brown.
The rationale behind Parker immunity is that Congress, in enacting the Sherman Act, evidenced no intent to restrain state behavior."	"In the small town of Willow Creek, the local government wanted to support its growing craft beer industry. The city council passed an ordinance requiring all breweries to purchase their ingredients from local suppliers, which in turn stipulated that they use a specific type of grass-seed for their hops. The regulation had a clear anticompetitive effect, as it limited the options for breweries and artificially inflated the cost of ingredients.

However, the city argued that the regulation was necessary to support local businesses and preserve the town's unique character. The brewery owners, eager to comply with the new rules, also argued that the ordinance was necessary to ensure the quality and consistency of the local beer.

One of the private breweries, Brew-tiful Day, approached the state's Department of Agriculture for guidance on complying with the ordinance. The department provided specific instructions on how to meet the grass-seed requirement, which included testing the soil and obtaining a certification from the department. Brew-tiful Day followed the department's instructions and obtained the necessary certification.

Under the Parker immunity doctrine, the city and the Department of Agriculture are immune from liability for antitrust violations because they exercised their legislative authority to create the regulation and provided guidance on its implementation. As a private actor, Brew-tiful Day can only challenge the validity of the ordinance, but not the actions of the government agencies that implemented it. This doctrine ensures that states and local governments have the flexibility to make decisions that may have anticompetitive effects, as long as they are acting within their legislative authority."
Parol evidence rule	"The parol evidence rule is a rule in common law jurisdictions limiting the kinds of evidence parties to a contract dispute can introduce when trying to determine the specific terms of a contract and precluding parties who have reduced their agreement to a final written document from later introducing other evidence, such as the content of oral discussions from earlier in the negotiation process, as evidence of a different intent as to the terms of the contract.  The rule provides that ""extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to vary a written contract"". The term ""parol"" derives from the Anglo-Norman French parol or parole, meaning ""word of mouth"" or ""verbal"", and in medieval times referred to oral pleadings in a court case.
The rule's  origins lie in English contract law, but it has been adopted in other common law jurisdictions; however there are now some differences between application of the rule in different jurisdictions. For instance, in the US, a common misconception is that it is a rule of evidence (like the Federal Rules of Evidence), but that is not the case; whereas in England it is indeed a rule of evidence.
The supporting rationale for excluding the content of verbal agreements from written contracts is that since the contracting parties have agreed to reduce their contract to a single and final writing, extrinsic evidence of past agreements or terms should not be considered when interpreting that writing, as the parties ultimately decided to leave them out of the contract. In other words, one may not use evidence made prior to the written contract to contradict the writing.

"	"Sarah and Alex had been planning their dream wedding for months. They had spent countless hours discussing every detail, from the flowers to the cake to the guest list. Finally, they decided to put all of their discussions in writing and signed a formal contract outlining the terms of the wedding. The contract explicitly stated that the cake would be vanilla-flavored, and the flowers would be white roses.

But on the day of the wedding, Sarah walked down the aisle to find a beautiful cake with chocolate frosting and red roses. Confused and upset, she approached Alex and asked why the cake and flowers were different from what they had agreed on. Alex apologized, explaining that they had changed their minds after signing the contract, and that their desire for a different cake and flowers had been ""just a small point"" that didn't matter.

Sarah was furious, and they ended up in court. The judge ruled that the terms of the contract were the only evidence that could be considered, and that extrinsic evidence of their oral discussions was inadmissible. This meant that Alex couldn't use their original discussions about the cake and flowers to contradict the contract, and the judge had to interpret the contract based solely on its written terms.

In the end, Sarah got the vanilla cake she had wanted, and Alex learned a valuable lesson about the importance of sticking to the written agreement. The parol evidence rule had protected Sarah's rights by preventing Alex from introducing extrinsic evidence that might have changed the meaning of the contract."
Peremptory norm	"A peremptory norm (also called jus cogens) is a fundamental principle of international law that is accepted by the international community of states as a norm from which no derogation is permitted.
There is no universal agreement regarding precisely which norms are jus cogens nor how a norm reaches that status, but it is generally accepted that jus cogens bans genocide, maritime piracy, enslaving in general (i.e. slavery as well as slave trade), wars of aggression and territorial aggrandizement, and generally as well torture, and refoulement."	"Here's a short story that illustrates the legal concept of peremptory norm or jus cogens:

The small coastal town of Porto Azul, nestled in the Caribbean, was devastated by the sudden arrival of a group of heavily armed mercenaries. The invaders, disguised as fishermen, had secretly set up a makeshift port and began to enslave the local population, forcing them to work under the threat of violence.

The government of Porto Azul, desperate to regain control, turned to the international community for help. The United Nations, horrified by the atrocities, quickly condemned the mercenaries' actions and demanded their immediate release of the enslaved population.

But the mercenaries, backed by a shadowy figure with a hidden agenda, refused to comply. They argued that they had a right to do as they pleased, as long as they weren't breaking any specific laws or treaties.

The international community, however, drew a clear line in the sand. They cited the peremptory norm of jus cogens - the fundamental principle that prohibits enslavement - and deemed the mercenaries' actions to be a grave violation of human rights. The international community condemned the mercenaries' actions as a ""[crime] against humanity, and a violation of the most fundamental norms of international law.""

In this fictional scenario, the peremptory norm of jus cogens - the prohibition on enslavement - provides a moral and legal imperative that transcends state interests. It represents a universal principle that is accepted as a norm from which no derogation is permitted, and is enforceable by the international community as a whole.

This story illustrates how jus cogens can be applied in a real-world scenario, highlighting the importance of this fundamental principle in protecting human rights and upholding international law."
Physical proximity doctrine	"The physical proximity doctrine is a standard in criminal law for distinguishing between preparation and attempt.: 683  ""Physical"" refers to the physical element of a criminal act (actus reus), as distinguished from the mental element of a guilty mind (mens rea). When a person makes preparation to commit a crime, and one of the preparatory acts is close or proximate to the completed crime, the preparation is considered to have merged into being an actual attempt.: 683  The standard is not a clear bright line standard.: 683  The closer the preparatory act is to the completed crime, the stronger the case for calling it an attempt.: 683  The determination as to whether the standard has been met is a matter for the jury to determine."	"Here's a fictional but realistic story that illustrates the legal concept of the Physical Proximity Doctrine:

Meet Sarah, a skilled pickpocket who's been watching her mark, a busy businessman, on the crowded streets of New York City for weeks. Sarah has been planning to steal his wallet, but it's always just out of reach - until today. As she follows him into the subway, she sees her chance. The train is packed, and the businessman is distracted by his phone. Sarah carefully makes her way to his side, her hand inches from his pocket.

Just as she's about to snatch the wallet, a sudden jolt of the train causes the businessman to shift his weight, giving Sarah just enough time to grab the wallet and pull it out of his pocket. But before she can rummage through it, a fellow passenger intervenes, suspecting something fishy, and grabs her arm.

As the police arrive, Sarah is charged with attempted larceny. Her defense team argues that she only made preparations to steal the wallet, never actually taking it. But the prosecution claims that her actions converged with the commission of the crime, making it an attempt. The jury is left to decide.

In this case, the physical proximity doctrine is relevant. Did Sarah's actions - namely, physically reaching for the wallet - transform her preparations from mere planning to attempting the crime? The answer lies in the jury's determination of whether Sarah's preparatory acts merged with the commission of the crime."
Pith and substance	"Pith and substance is a legal doctrine in Canadian constitutional interpretation used to determine under which head of power a given piece of legislation falls. The doctrine is primarily used when a law is challenged on the basis that one level of government (be it provincial or federal) has encroached upon the exclusive jurisdiction of another level of government. 
The Constitution Act, 1867, which established a federal constitution for Canada, enumerated in Sections 91 and 92 the topics on which the Dominion and the Provinces could respectively legislate. Notwithstanding that the lists were framed so as to be fairly full and comprehensive, soon it was found that the topics enumerated in the two sections overlapped, and the Privy Council repeatedly had to rule on the constitutionality of laws made by the federal and provincial legislatures. It was in this situation that the Privy Council evolved the doctrine that, for deciding whether an impugned legislation was intra vires (within its powers), regard must be had to its pith and substance.
Thus, if a statute is found in substance to relate to a topic within the competence of the legislature, it should be held to be intra vires even though it might incidentally trench on topics not within its legislative competence. The extent of the encroachment on matters beyond its competence may be an element in determining whether the legislation is colourable: whether in the guise of making a law on a matter within its competence, the legislature is, in truth, making a law on a subject beyond its competence. However, where that is not the position, the fact of encroachment does not affect the vires of the law even as regards the area of encroachment.

"	"Meet Sarah, a passionate environmentalist who owns a small farm in rural Ontario. She's been fighting to protect her land from a proposed highway expansion project that would cut through her property and threaten the nearby forest ecosystem. Sarah is concerned that the project would not only destroy her farm but also harm the local wildlife and contaminate the waters.

The federal government announces plans to build the highway, citing its constitutional powers to regulate ""natural resources"" under Section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867. Sarah, however, argues that this is an encroachment on the provincial government's exclusive jurisdiction to manage ""local works and undertakings"" under Section 92(10).

To decide whether the federal government's move is constitutional, the courts must apply the doctrine of ""pith and substance"" to determine the true purpose of the highway project. In essence, they must look beyond the incidental effects of the project and focus on its core objective.

Upon examination, it becomes clear that the primary purpose of the highway is to improve infrastructure and facilitate economic growth – a matter within the federal government's jurisdiction. While the project may incidentally affect local works and undertakings, this is not its primary purpose.

The court finds that the highway project is constitutional, as its pith and substance relate to federal powers under Section 91(24). The provincial government's jurisdiction over local works and undertakings is not directly affected, and any incidental encroachment is not enough to render the project unconstitutional.

Sarah's fight may not have succeeded, but she ultimately helped shape the legal framework that governs Canada's constitution, illuminating the importance of looking beyond surface-level effects to understand the true pith and substance of a legislation."
Plain meaning rule	"The plain meaning rule, also known as the literal rule, is one of three rules of statutory construction traditionally applied by English courts. The other two are the ""mischief rule"" and the ""golden rule"".
The plain meaning rule dictates that statutes are to be interpreted using the ordinary meaning of the language of the statute. In other words, a statute is to be read word for word and is to be interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the language, unless a statute explicitly defines some of its terms otherwise or unless the result would be cruel or absurd.  Ordinary words are given their ordinary meaning, technical terms are given their technical meaning, and local, cultural terms are recognized as applicable. The plain meaning rule is the mechanism that prevents courts from taking sides in legislative or political issues. Additionally, it is the mechanism that underlies textualism and, to a certain extent, originalism."	"Meet Sarah, a local small business owner who runs a successful bakery in a small town. She has been operating her business for several years and has always been compliant with all relevant regulations. Recently, the town council passed a new ordinance requiring all food establishments to have a ""reasonable and adequate"" ventilation system installed.

Sarah has a small bakery and has always relied on the natural ventilation provided by the open windows and doors. However, she is concerned that installing a ventilation system will significantly increase her overhead costs and potentially disrupt her business.

Sarah decides to seek clarification on the ordinance, fearing that she might be in violation. She visits the town's planning department and asks about the specific requirements for the ventilation system. The planning officer shows her the text of the ordinance, which reads: ""All food establishments shall be equipped with a reasonable and adequate ventilation system to prevent the accumulation of dust and fumes.""

Sarah asks for an interpretation of the term ""reasonable and adequate,"" but the officer tells her that it is meant to be taken at face value. ""The language is straightforward,"" the officer explains. ""It means that the system needs to be sufficient to prevent dust and fumes from accumulating. It's up to you to determine what that means in your specific situation.""

Sarah leaves the planning department feeling relieved that she doesn't need to install a elaborate and expensive ventilation system. The plain meaning rule helped her interpret the ordinance in a way that was fair and reasonable, without requiring the court to take sides in a legislative issue."
Police power (United States constitutional law)	"In United States constitutional law, the police power is the capacity of the states and the federal government to regulate behavior and enforce order within their territory for the betterment of the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of their inhabitants. Police power is defined in each jurisdiction by the legislative body, which determines the public purposes that need to be served by legislation. Under the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states or to the people. As a result, the police power is primarily concentrated within state governments, while the federal government possesses it in limited contexts where it has an express power, such as over conduct occurring within the territories of the United States and activities related to interstate commerce.
Police power is exercised by the legislative and executive branches of the various states through the enactment and enforcement of laws and regulations. States have the power to compel obedience to these laws through whatever measures they see fit, provided these measures do not infringe upon any of the rights protected by the United States Constitution or their own state constitutions and are not unreasonably arbitrary or oppressive. Methods of enforcement can include legal sanctions and physical means. Controversies over the exercise of state police power can arise when exercise by state authorities conflicts with individual rights and freedoms. 
Most criminal cases are prosecuted in the name of the governmental authority that promulgates criminal statutes and enforces the police power of the state with the goal of seeking criminal sanctions."	"It's a sweltering summer evening in the small town of Oakdale. The local residents are enjoying the annual July 4th celebration, but the festive mood is shattered when a vendor, Joe, sets up an unlicensed and unhygienic food stand near the town square. The smell of stale hot dogs and rotting watermelons wafts through the air, attracting a swarm of flies and causing health concerns for the attendees.

Mayor Sarah, concerned for the well-being of her citizens, calls upon the town's health inspector, Mark, to shut down Joe's stand. Mark issues a cease-and-desist order, citing the state's health and safety regulations, which aim to protect the public from harm. Joe refuses to comply, claiming that his stand is just a ""harmless"" way to make a living.

The town council, exercising its police power, passes an ordinance making it mandatory for food vendors to obtain a permit and meet certain health and safety standards. The council also authorizes the town's health department to enforce the regulations and issue fines to violators.

Joe is ultimately fined and forced to close his stand, but he feels that the regulations are an overreach of the government's power. The controversy sparks a heated debate among the townspeople, with some arguing that the regulations are necessary to protect public health, while others believe they infringe on Joe's right to operate a business.

In this scenario, the town of Oakdale exercises its police power to regulate the food vendor's activities, ensuring the health and safety of its citizens. While individual rights and freedoms are balanced against the need for government regulation, the ultimate goal is to promote the general welfare of the community."
Political question	"In United States constitutional law, the political question doctrine holds that a constitutional dispute requiring knowledge of a non-legal character, techniques not suitable for a court, or matters explicitly assigned by the Constitution to Legislative or Executive branches lies within the political realm, rather than the judiciary. Judges customarily refuse to address such matters as a matter of justiciability, questioning whether their courts are an appropriate forum for the case. Legal questions are deemed justiciable, while political questions are nonjusticiable. One scholar explained:

The political question doctrine holds that some questions, in their nature, are fundamentally political, and not legal, and if a question is fundamentally political ... then the court will refuse to hear that case. It will claim that it doesn't have jurisdiction. And it will leave that question to some other aspect of the political process to settle out.
A ruling of nonjusticiability prevents a case's core issue from being resolved in a court of law. When the issue involves duties not addressed by the Constitution, courts leave it to the democratic process, rather than resolving political disputes themselves.

"	"As the sun set over the city, Mayor Sarah Jenkins sat in her office, reflecting on the contentious decision facing her administration. The city council had proposed a new tax to fund infrastructure projects, but a group of local citizens had filed a lawsuit, claiming the tax was unconstitutional and arguing that the city council had no authority to implement it.

The mayor had always been mindful of the importance of the separation of powers and the limits of the judicial system. She knew that this matter, by its very nature, was fundamentally political – a question of legislative power, not a legal one. The citizens' dispute was with the city council, not the court system.

As the case made its way to the city's supreme court, the judges were faced with a difficult decision. After careful consideration, they deemed the question nonjusticiable, effectively throwing out the lawsuit. The mayor was relieved, knowing that the court had correctly recognized the political nature of the dispute.

""This decision is a clear example of the political question doctrine in action,"" said the judge, stressing that the role of the judiciary was to interpret the law, not make political decisions. ""We cannot create laws or solve political problems through litigation. That is the responsibility of the legislative and executive branches of government.""

The mayor and the city council were relieved to have finally resolved the matter, and the city's infrastructure projects could move forward, funded by the newly passed tax. The citizens, though disappointed, understood that the court's decision was justified, and they would have to take their concerns to the political arena, where they could be heard and addressed through the democratic process."
Polluter pays principle	In environmental law, the polluter pays principle is enacted to make the party responsible for producing pollution responsible for paying for the damage done to the natural environment. This principle has also been used to put the costs of pollution prevention on the polluter.  It is regarded as a regional custom because of the strong support it has received in most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and European Union countries, and has a strong scientific basis in economics. It is a fundamental principle in US environmental law.	"Meet Emma, a small business owner who owns a factory that produces recycled paper products. Her business has been thriving for years, but recently, Emma has been receiving complaints from the local community about the unpleasant odor and pollution emanating from her factory.

One day, a group of local residents, including Sarah, a young mother, and Jake, a avid fisherman, decided to take matters into their own hands. They conducted their own research and discovered that the factory was releasing toxic chemicals into the nearby river, causing harm to the local wildlife and contaminating the drinking water.

The community banded together and demanded that Emma take action to clean up the pollution and prevent further harm. Emma, realizing the gravity of the situation, agreed to work with the community to implement pollution controls and clean up the river.

However, the cost of the cleanup and pollution controls put a significant strain on Emma's business. That's when the government stepped in, enforcing the polluter pays principle. Emma was required to pay for the costs of the cleanup and pollution controls, as well as compensation to the affected residents.

In this scenario, Emma, the polluter, is held accountable for the damage done to the environment and the local community. The polluter pays principle ensures that the company responsible for pollution is responsible for cleaning up and paying for the harm caused, rather than passing the costs onto taxpayers or nearby residents. This principle helps to promote a cleaner and healthier environment for all."
Posting rule	"The posting rule (or mailbox rule in the United States, also known as the ""postal rule"" or ""deposited acceptance rule"") is an exception to the general rule of contract law in common law countries that acceptance of an offer takes place when communicated. Under the posting rule, that acceptance takes effect when a letter is posted (that is, dropped in a post box or handed to a postal worker); the post office will be the universal service provider, such as the UK's Royal Mail, the Australia Post, or the United States Postal Service. In plain English, the ""meeting of the minds"" necessary to contract formation occurs at the exact moment word of acceptance is sent via post by the person accepting it, rather than when that acceptance is received by the person who offered the contract.
The rules of contracts by post (postal rules) include the following:

An offer made by post/letter is not effective until received by the offeree.
Acceptance is effective as soon as it is posted.
For revocation to be effective, it must be received by the offeree before they post their letter of acceptance.
One rationale given for the rule is that the offeror nominates the post office as his or her implied agent, and thus receipt of the acceptance by the post office is regarded as receipt by the offeror. The main effect of the posting rule is that the risk of acceptance being delivered late or lost in the post is placed upon the offeror. If the offeror is reluctant to accept this risk, he can always expressly require actual receipt as a condition before being legally bound by his offer."	"Here's a story that illustrates the posting rule in a relatable scenario:

Emily, a music enthusiast, spends hours searching for the perfect guitar online. She finally finds her dream guitar at a boutique shop, but it's all the way across the country in Seattle. The guitar maker, Jamie, agrees to sell it to Emily for $500 if she transfers the payment to his bank account by the end of the week. Emily is thrilled and quickly writes the check, folds it, and puts it in an envelope addressed to Jamie. Before sealing the envelope, she adds a polite note saying she's accepted the offer and is sending the payment.

As she walks to the post office to mail the letter, Emily realizes she's running a bit late but decides to post it anyway, hoping it will arrive before the weekend. She hands the letter to the postal worker, and it disappears into the mailstream.

The next day, Jamie receives an email from his bank stating that the payment has been processed, but he doesn't receive the physical letter from Emily until Monday morning. Later that day, Jamie contacts Emily to confirm receipt of the payment and discusses the guitar details. Emily is surprised to learn that Jamie is already aware of the payment and seems relieved that everything is taken care of.

Under the posting rule, Jamie accepted Emily's offer when he put the letter in the post box, even though he didn't receive the physical letter until Monday. The post office acted as Jamie's implied agent, delivering the acceptance to him when it was received. This means that Emily's offer was accepted, and the contract was formed, as soon as the letter was posted, not when Jamie received it."
Pottery Barn rule	"The Pottery Barn rule is an American expression alluding to a policy of ""you break it, you've bought it"" or ""you break it, you buy it"" or ""you break it, you remake it"", by which a retail store holds a customer responsible for damage done to merchandise on display. It generally ""encourages customers to be more careful when handling property that's not theirs"". It is an analogy often used in the political or military arena to suggest that if an actor inadvertently creates a problem, the actor is obliged to provide the resources necessary to correct it."	"It was a busy Saturday at the local pottery store, Jenna's Clay. Amidst the chaos, Emma, a curious 7-year-old, wandered into the display area and accidentally knocked over a beautifully crafted vase, shattering it into a hundred pieces.

The store owner, Mrs. Thompson, approached Emma with a kind but firm tone. ""Emma, I'm glad you like our pottery, but it's not yours to play with. Now, the vase is broken, and we have to remake it,"" she explained. Emma looked on, feeling guilty and worried.

Mrs. Thompson wasn't imposing a fine on Emma, but rather emphasized the importance of being responsible when handling company property. ""If you break it, you remake it,"" she said. Emma's parents agreed to help with the cost of the reconstruction, realizing that it was their responsibility as well.

As they left the store, Emma's dad turned to her and said, ""Remember, Emma, when we're at someone else's place, we need to be careful not to break anything. It's like Mrs. Thompson said – if you break it, you remake it."" The Pottery Barn rule had just been taught to Emma, a valuable lesson she would carry with her for years to come."
Pre-existing duty rule	"The pre-existing duty rule is an aspect of consideration within the law of contract. Originating in England the concept of consideration has been adopted by other jurisdictions, including the US.
In essence, this rule declares that performance of a pre-existing duty does not amount to good consideration to support a valid contract; but there are exceptions to the rule."	"Meet Emma, a dedicated employee of XYZ Corporation. She's been working there for five years, consistently delivering high-quality work and taking on additional responsibilities whenever needed. The company's sales have steadily increased during her tenure, and her efforts have been instrumental in driving this growth.

One day, her boss, John, approaches her with a request. He asks Emma to continue her excellent work and take on even more responsibilities, including overseeing a new project that will further boost the company's sales. In exchange, John promises to give Emma a 10% raise and a bonus.

At first glance, it seems like a fair deal. Emma is already committed to delivering high-quality work, and the company is reaping the benefits. However, Emma is concerned about the lack of consideration in the offer. She points out that she's already fulfilling her duties as an employee, and the company is simply asking her to do more of the same.

John reassures her that her expanded role will be recognized and rewarded with a bonus and raise. Emma is skeptical, but ultimately agrees to take on the new responsibilities.

In this scenario, Emma's actions don't constitute good consideration to support a valid contract. She was already under a duty to fulfill her job requirements, and the company's request only asks her to perform what she was already obligated to do. The pre-existing duty rule applies, and Emma's compensation changes should be viewed as a reward for her hard work, rather than a legally binding contract."
Precautionary principle	"The precautionary principle (or precautionary approach) is a broad epistemological, philosophical and legal approach to innovations with potential for causing harm when extensive scientific knowledge on the matter is lacking. It emphasizes caution, pausing and review before leaping into new innovations that may prove disastrous. Critics argue that it is vague, self-cancelling, unscientific and an obstacle to progress.
In an engineering context, the precautionary principle manifests itself as the factor of safety. It was apparently suggested, in civil engineering, by Belidor in 1729. Interrelation between safety factor and reliability is extensively studied by engineers and philosophers.
The principle is often used by policy makers in situations where there is the possibility of harm from making a certain decision (e.g. taking a particular course of action) and conclusive evidence is not yet available. For example, a government may decide to limit or restrict the widespread release of a medicine or new technology until it has been thoroughly tested. The principle acknowledges that while the progress of science and technology has often brought great benefit to humanity, it has also contributed to the creation of new threats and risks. It implies that there is a social responsibility to protect the public from exposure to such harm, when scientific investigation has found a plausible risk. These protections should be relaxed only if further scientific findings emerge that provide sound evidence that no harm will result.
The principle has become an underlying rationale for a large and increasing number of international treaties and declarations in the fields of sustainable development, environmental protection, health, trade, and food safety, although at times it has attracted debate over how to accurately define it and apply it to complex scenarios with multiple risks. In some legal systems, as in law of the European Union, the application of the precautionary principle has been made a statutory requirement in some areas of law."	"As the sun set over the small town of Willow Creek, the local mayor, Sarah, gathered with her team to discuss a pressing issue. A new biotech company, Green Earth, had submitted a proposal to introduce genetically modified mosquitoes to the area's wetlands to combat a growing mosquito-borne disease problem.

While some argued that the technology could be a game-changer, others raised concerns about potential unintended consequences. There was limited research on the long-term effects of releasing modified mosquitoes into the ecosystem, and some experts warned that it could lead to unforeseen changes to the food chain.

Sarah and her team knew that they had to make a decision, but they were torn. On one hand, the company claimed that the technology was safe and effective, and that it would be a major breakthrough in disease prevention. On the other hand, they didn't know for sure.

In this moment, the precautionary principle came into play. Sarah remembered a wise saying: ""It's better to be safe than sorry."" She decided to pause the decision-making process and order further research and testing before giving the company the green light.

The team agreed, and together they took a cautious approach. They consulted with experts, reviewed data, and conducted thorough environmental impact assessments. After several months of hard work, they finally made a decision. While the technology showed promise, the risks were still too great, and the town decided to reject Green Earth's proposal.

Years later, when the full extent of the technology's potential consequences became apparent, the people of Willow Creek felt vindicated. The town had taken a cautious approach, and in doing so, had protected its environment and its citizens from potential harm. The precautionary principle had guided their decision-making, and they were proud of their wise and responsible choice."
Precedent	"Precedent is a judicial decision that serves as an authority for courts when deciding subsequent identical or similar cases. Fundamental to common law legal systems, precedent operates under the principle of stare decisis (""to stand by things decided""), where past judicial decisions serve as case law to guide future rulings, thus promoting consistency and predictability.
Precedent is a defining feature that sets common law systems apart from civil law systems. In common law, precedent can either be something courts must follow (binding) or something they can consider but do not have to follow (persuasive). Civil law systems, in contrast, are characterized by comprehensive codes and detailed statutes, with no emphasis on precedent, and where judges primarily focus on fact-finding and applying codified law.
Courts in common law systems rely heavily on case law, which refers to the collection of precedents and legal principles established by previous judicial decisions on specific issues or topics. The development of case law depends on the systematic publication and indexing of these decisions in law reports, making them accessible to lawyers, courts, and the general public.
Generally speaking, a legal precedent may be:

applied (if precedent is binding) / adopted (if precedent is persuasive), if the principles underpinning the previous decision are accordingly used to evaluate the issues of the subsequent case;
distinguished, if the principles underpinning the previous decision are found specific to, or premised upon, certain factual scenarios, and not applied to the subsequent case because of the absence or material difference in the latter's facts;
modified, if the same court on determination of the same case on order from a higher court modified one or more parts of the previous decision; or
overruled, if the same or higher courts on appeal or determination of subsequent cases found the principles underpinning the previous decision erroneous in law or overtaken by new legislation or developments."	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of precedent:

In the year 2000, a Canadian couple, John and Emma, got married in a small ceremony in British Columbia. After the wedding, they spent several years living together and raising their two children. However, in 2020, the couple's relationship began to deteriorate due to financial disagreements, and eventually, they decided to file for divorce.

During the divorce proceedings, the judge in the case, Justice Smith, held that the couple had a valid common-law marriage, based on the understanding that in British Columbia, a common-law marriage can be recognized as a valid alternative to a traditional marriage. The judge's decision was published and later became a precedent.

Fast-forward to 2025, when another Canadian couple, Michael and Sophia, divorced in Ontario. They also argued that they had a valid common-law marriage, citing the 2020 precedent in the John and Emma case. However, the judge in the Michael and Sophia case, Justice Lee, was hesitant to follow the precedent, citing differences in the laws of British Columbia and Ontario.

After reviewing the cases, Justice Lee decided that the precedent was persuasive but not binding. She found that while the principles underpinning the John and Emma case were relevant, they were specific to the circumstances in British Columbia and didn't necessarily apply to the situation in Ontario. As a result, Justice Lee distinguished the two cases, applying a different legal principle to the Michael and Sophia case.

This story illustrates how precedent works in common law systems. The John and Emma case set a precedent that was considered persuasive but not binding. The court in the Michael and Sophia case drew on the principles of the precedent but modified their decision to fit the specific circumstances of the new case, demonstrating the concept of distinguishing precedents."
Preparation and attempt	"Preparation and attempt are related, but different standards in criminal law.: 681–4 
An attempt to commit an unconsummated crime is viewed as having the same gravity as if the crime had occurred. But preparation that falls short of an actual attempt is not, although it may be punishable in some other way.
Courts have not been able to draw a clear bright line as to when acts committed in preparation for a crime are actually an attempt to commit the crime.
Some approaches, summarized in the case of United States v. Mandujano, include the physical proximity doctrine, the dangerous proximity doctrine, the indispensable element test, the probable desistance test, the abnormal step approach, and the uneqivocality test.
The Model Penal Code approach requires a substantial step, in addition to having a criminal purpose.

"	"Here's a story that illustrates the legal concept of preparation and attempt:

Sarah, a struggling artist, had been planning to rob a local art gallery for months. She had been casing the place, studying the security cameras and alarms, and even made a rough blueprint of the layout. She had also gathered a small toolkit and a disguise, just in case.

One day, she decided to put her plan into action. She put on the disguise and walked to the gallery, tool belt in hand. As she approached the door, she noticed that the security guard was distracted by his phone. With hesitation, Sarah stopped just short of the door, unsure if she should go through with the plan.

In this scenario, Sarah's actions are a clear example of preparation for a crime, but not an attempt to commit the crime. She stopped short of actually entering the gallery, and there is no evidence that she intended to take a ""substantial step"" towards completing the robbery.

In a court of law, a judge might consider Sarah's actions under the Model Penal Code's approach, which requires a showing of a ""substantial step"" towards completing the crime. Since Sarah didn't take any actual steps towards committing the robbery, her actions would likely be considered mere preparation, rather than an attempt to commit the crime."
Presumption	"In law, a presumption is an ""inference of a particular fact"". There are two types of presumptions: rebuttable presumptions and irrebuttable (or conclusive) presumptions.: 25  A rebuttable presumption will either shift the burden of production (requiring the disadvantaged party to produce some evidence to the contrary) or the burden of proof (requiring the disadvantaged party to show the presumption is wrong); in short, a fact finder can reject a rebuttable presumption based on other evidence.: 87  Conversely, a conclusive/irrebuttable presumption cannot be challenged by contradictory facts or evidence.: 87–88  Sometimes, a presumption must be triggered by a predicate fact—that is, the fact must be found before the presumption applies.: 1321–22 "	"Meet Sarah, a 35-year-old mother who was involved in a minor car accident on her way to work. The other driver, a young man in his early twenties, initially fled the scene, leaving Sarah shaken and confused. When the police arrived, they took statements from the few witnesses on the scene and gathered some physical evidence. However, the driver who hit Sarah was never caught.

As a result, the court needed to infer what had happened to determine who was at fault. The court followed a common legal principle, known as a rebuttable presumption. In this case, the presumption was that the driver who fled the scene was likely responsible for the accident. This means that unless Sarah or her witnesses could produce evidence to the contrary, it was assumed that the young man was indeed the one who hit her.

However, Sarah was determined to prove that another car, driven by a nearby resident, was responsible for the accident. She gathered witness statements and video footage that showed the other driver was in the area at the time of the crash. In court, Sarah presented her evidence, which contradicted the initial presumption. The judge considered all the evidence, including the presumption, and ultimately ruled in Sarah's favor, finding that the resident driver was indeed responsible for the accident.

In this scenario, the rebuttable presumption was an inference of a particular fact, which shifted the burden of proof to Sarah to provide evidence to the contrary. While the presumption was initially in favor of the young man, Sarah's evidence was enough to rebut it and prove her case."
Presumption (Catholic canon law)	"Presumption in the canon law of the Catholic Church is a term signifying a reasonable conjecture concerning something doubtful, drawn from arguments and appearances, which by the force of circumstances can be accepted as a proof. It is on this presumption our common adage is based: ""Possession is nine points of the law"". Presumption has its place in canon law only when positive proofs are wanting, and yet the formulation of some judgment is necessary. It is never in itself an absolute proof, as it only presumes that something is true. Canonists divide presumption into:

presumption of law (juris), or that which is deduced from some legal precept or authority expressed in law or based upon precedents or similarities, and
presumption of a judge or man (judicis or hominis), when the law is silent on the subject and an opinion must be formed according to the way that circumstances and indications would affect a prudent man or judge."	"Father Michael was the administrator of a small parish in a rural town. One morning, he began investigating the validity of a large donation given by a elderly widow to the parish. Upon arrival, he discovered that the woman, Mrs. Johnson, had been receiving loans from the church over the past few months, totaling thousands of dollars. However, there was no paper trail or agreement between the parties, except a few receipts with faint notations on them.

Father Michael also discovered that the woman had a troubled past, having spent much of her life in foster care and struggling with addiction issues. He remembered her being very grateful when receiving assistance from the church, often seeming overly reliant on their charity.

Considering these facts, Father Michael leaned away from suspecting that the woman gave the donation genuinely, given the absence of documents and her circumstances. However, he couldn't dismiss the idea entirely, as there had been instances where those struggling with past issues returned to help the parish in quiet, unpublicized ways.

As she was otherwise able and willing to share her time and talents when aiding the community, and acknowledging that possessions can hide complex contexts, Father Michael found himself having a certain degree of plausible doubt about Mrs. Johnson's intentions."
Presumption of constitutionality	In constitutional law, the presumption of constitutionality is the legal principle that the judiciary should presume statutes enacted by the legislature to be constitutional, unless the law is clearly unconstitutional or a fundamental right is implicated.	"Meet Sarah, a single mother working two jobs to make ends meet. She's struggling to provide for her two young children, and the government's new education policy has added to her stress. As part of the policy, schools are now required to charge a fee for extracurricular activities, affecting students from low-income families like Sarah's.

Sarah is concerned that this new policy will further widen the gap between her children's education and those from more affluent backgrounds. She decides to take legal action, arguing that the policy violates her children's constitutional right to equal access to education.

In court, the key issue is whether the policy is constitutional or not. Sarah's lawyer argues that the policy unfairly burdens low-income students, violating their equal protection rights under the constitution. The government, on the other hand, argues that the policy is constitutional and necessary to ensure the sustainability of the public education system.

In a landmark judgement, the court decides in favor of the government, ruling that the policy is constitutional. Despite Sarah's concerns, the court applies the presumption of constitutionality, assuming that the government had a legitimate purpose and acted reasonably in enacting the policy. The court finds that while the policy may have some unfortunate effects, the burden of proof lies with Sarah to demonstrate that the policy is clearly unconstitutional.

This case illustrates the principle of the presumption of constitutionality, where the judiciary decides in favor of the government unless there is clear evidence that the law is unconstitutional or impinges on fundamental rights. In this instance, the court put the burden on Sarah to show that the education policy was indeed unconstitutional, which she ultimately failed to do."
Presumption of guilt	"A presumption of guilt is any presumption within the criminal justice system that a person is guilty of a crime, for example a presumption that a suspect is guilty unless or until proven to be innocent.  Such a presumption may legitimately arise from a rule of law or a procedural rule of the court or other adjudicating body which determines how the facts in the case are to be proved, and may be either rebuttable or irrebuttable. An irrebuttable presumption of fact may not be challenged by the defense, and the presumed fact is taken as having been proved.  A rebuttable presumption shifts the burden of proof onto the defense, who must collect and present evidence to prove the suspect's innocence, in order to obtain acquittal.
Rebuttable presumptions of fact, arising during the course of a trial as a result of specific factual situations (for example that the accused has taken flight), are common; an opening presumption of guilt based on the mere fact that the suspect has been charged is considered illegitimate in many countries, and contrary to international human rights standards. In the United States, an irrebuttable presumption of guilt is considered to be unconstitutional. Informal and legally illegitimate presumptions of guilt may also arise from the attitudes or prejudices of those such as judges, lawyers or police officers who administer the system. Such presumptions may result in suspects who are innocent being brought before a court to face criminal charges, with a risk of improperly being found guilty."	"Maria was a successful businesswoman who owned a small boutique in a trendy neighborhood. One day, a valuable necklace went missing from her store, and the police were called to investigate. Within hours, they arrested Maria and charged her with theft, claiming she must have taken the necklace herself.

As Maria's trial approached, she was dismayed to discover that the court's demeanor towards her had changed. The judge seemed skeptical, the prosecutor was aggressive, and even the jurors cast suspicious glances her way. Maria felt she was being treated as guilty until proven innocent, rather than the other way around.

At trial, the prosecution presented circumstantial evidence, including the fact that Maria had been seen arguing with a former employee a few days prior. But Maria knew she had never stolen anything in her life, let alone the valuable necklace. Her lawyer, a seasoned advocate, urged her to present her side of the story and defend herself against the allegations.

The jury delivered a guilty verdict, and Maria was sentenced to five years in prison. She later discovered that the former employee was a witness for the prosecution, and the detective who investigated the case had a history of unfairly targeting small business owners. Maria realized that she was the victim of a rebuttable presumption of guilt, fueled by the detective's biases and the prosecution's ruthless pursuit of a conviction.

Maria's conviction was later overturned on appeal, and she was exonerated of the crime. She vowed to use her experience to advocate for reform, ensuring that future victims of rebuttable presumptions of guilt received the justice they deserved."
Presumption of innocence	"The presumption of innocence is a legal principle that every person accused of any crime is considered innocent until proven guilty. Under the presumption of innocence, the legal burden of proof is thus on the prosecution, which must present compelling evidence to the trier of fact (a judge or a jury).  If the prosecution does not prove the charges true, then the person is acquitted of the charges. The prosecution must in most cases prove that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If reasonable doubt remains, the accused must be acquitted.  The opposite system is a presumption of guilt.
In many countries and under many legal systems, including common law and civil law systems (not to be confused with the other kind of civil law, which deals with non-criminal legal issues), the presumption of innocence is a legal right of the accused in a criminal trial.  It is also an international human right under the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 11."	"It was a typical Monday morning when Emma received a knock on the door from two police officers. They had a warrant to search her home and take her in for questioning regarding a string of burglaries in the neighborhood. Emma was shocked and protested her innocence. The officers explained that a neighbor had reported seeing a woman matching Emma's description fleeing the scene of one of the burglaries.

As the officers escorted Emma away, she couldn't shake the feeling of relief that her husband, John, was at home watching over their children. She had been working late that night and had been home in time"
Principle of conferral	"The principle of conferral is a fundamental principle of European Union law. According to this principle, the EU is a union of its member states, and all its competences are voluntarily conferred on it by its member states. The Union has no competences by right, and thus any areas of policy not explicitly agreed in treaties by all member states remain the domain of the member states. This indicates that the member states have the right to deal with all matters that fall outside the agreements of the Treaties and the EU can only act within the conferred competences defined by the Member States in the treaties.
This principle has always underpinned the European Union, but it was explicitly specified for the first time in the proposed and rejected Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. The principle carried over into its replacement, the Treaty on European Union (TEU). It is spelled out fully in Articles 4 and 5 of the TEU.
Both Articles make clear that the Union acts only within the limits of the competences conferred upon it by the Member States, but then state clearly that ""Competences not conferred upon the Union in the Treaties remain with the Member States."" Article 4(1) repeats this and goes on to stipulate that ""The Union shall respect the equality of Member States before the Treaties as well as their national identities, inherent in their fundamental structures, political and constitutional, inclusive of regional and local self-government. It shall respect their essential State functions, including ensuring the territorial integrity of the State, maintaining law and order and safeguarding national security. In particular, national security remains the sole responsibility of each Member State.""
In many areas the Union has shared competence with the Member States. Once the Union has passed legislation in these fields competence moves to the Union.

"	"Alessia, a passionate Italian chef, had just moved to Paris to start her own brioche bakery in the city's famous Latin Quarter. As she was unpacking her pastry bags and mixing bowls, she received a call from the newly established European Union's Director-General of Food Regulation.

""Bonjour, Madame Alessia,"" the Director-General said. ""I'm calling from Brussels. We've noticed that you're opening a bakery in Paris, and we need to discuss the EU's regulations on food labeling. The EU has rules governing the description of 'traditional' foods, and we've decided to clarify that the term 'brioche' can only be used for French brioche that meets our certification standards.""

Alessia was taken aback, as her family's traditional Italian brioche recipe didn't quite fit the EU's definition. She felt that her Italian brioche was just as authentic and delicious as any French brioche. But according to the EU, since France had conferred specific competences on the EU regarding food labeling, the EU had the authority to regulate the use of the term 'brioche' across the entire union – as long as they stayed within the limits of those conferred competences.

Alessia explained that she had French and Italian clients asking her to label her Italian brioche as ' French brioche' to comply with the rules, but she didn't want to misrepresent her product. The Director-General reassured her that the EU respected member states' national identities and cultural heritage, and the EU's role was only to ensure that 'traditional' foods met basic safety and labeling standards.

Feeling a bit more at ease, Alessia agreed to apply for certification for her Italian brioche, while also pitching the idea of more cooperation between EU countries on cultural heritage foods."
Principle of legality in criminal law	"The principle of legality in criminal law was developed in the eighteenth century by the Italian criminal lawyer Cesare Beccaria and holds that no one can be convicted of a crime without a previously published legal text which clearly describes the crime (Latin: nulla poena sine lege, lit. 'no punishment without law'). This principle is accepted and codified in modern democratic states as a basic requirement of the rule of law. It has been described as ""one of the most 'widely held value-judgement[s] in the entire history of human thought ' ""."	"In the small town of Willow Creek, Maria was charged with and convicted of theft. The prosecutor alleged that she had stolen a necklace from the local jewelry store. However, the problem was that the law on theft in the state did not specify what constitutes theft. There was no clear definition, no specific boundaries between theft and borrowing, and no guidelines on what constitutes a ""stolen"" item.

During the trial, Maria's lawyer pointed out that the lack of a clear definition of theft created uncertainty and made it difficult for her to defend herself. The judge agreed, and the prosecution struggled to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Maria had committed the crime.

As a result, Maria was acquitted due to the lack of a previously published legal text that clearly described the crime. This decision was based on the principle of legality, which holds that no one can be punished without a clear and specific legal provision that defines the crime.

The community was initially upset with the outcome, but eventually, they realized that the principle of legality was essential to ensure fairness and justice. The town council then passed a new law that clearly defined theft, providing specific guidelines and penalties. From then on, Maria would have faced stiffer penalties for committing the crime if she had indeed stolen the necklace."
Principle of legality in French criminal law	"The principle of legality in French criminal law holds that no one may be convicted of a criminal offense unless a previously published legal text sets out in clear and precise wording the constituent elements of the offense and the penalty which applies to it.
(Latin:Nullum crimen, nulla pœna sine lege, in other words, ""no crime, no penalty, without a law"").
The principle of legality (French: principe de légalité) is one of the most fundamental principles of French criminal law, and goes back to the Penal Code of 1791 adopted during the French Revolution, and before that, was developed by Italian criminologist Cesare Beccaria and by Montesquieu. The principle has its origins in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which endows it with constitutional force and limits the conditions in which citizens may be punished for infractions."	"The small town of Évian-les-Bains was known for its picturesque lakefront and bustling summer markets. However, one August evening, a heated argument between two local vendors, Pierre and Jacques, ended in a struggle. Pierre, a popular patisserie owner, claimed Jacques, a young street performer, had intentionally knocked over his prized display of freshly baked croissants. Jacques, insisting it was an accident, stormed off, leaving Pierre fuming.

The next day, Pierre reported the incident to the town authorities and demanded Jacques be charged with intentional destruction of property. The local prosecutor, Madame Rousseau, was tasked with investigating the case.

Problematically, the town's ordinance dealing with criminal damage did not explicitly specify the wording and elements of the crime. Should Jacques' actions be considered intentional destruction, or was it merely careless? The prosecutor's dilemma was clear: without a precise definition, could Jacques be found guilty of a crime that didn't decisively outline the exact circumstances that made the action criminal?

As Madame Rousseau struggled to move forward with the case, she realized that the lack of clarity in the town's ordinance would render any conviction questionable. She decided to consult with the district attorney, who ultimately agreed that the case must be dropped due to the ambiguity in the law. ""Nullum crimen, nulla pœna sine lege,"" the principle of legality reminded them: without a clear law defining the crime and its punishment, no one could be held accountable for it.

In the end, Jacques and Pierre agreed to settle their dispute amicably, and the town of Évian-les-Bains took note of the importance of the principle of legality, ensuring that its laws were clear and precise to prevent future misunderstandings."
Principle of typicality	The principle of typicality (from the Greek term typikos which means model) is a general legal principle that takes on different meanings in contexts.	"As the sun set over the small town of Willow Creek, a local restaurateur, Maria, was hosting a grand reopening ceremony for her newly renovated Italian trattoria, Bella Vita. The event was packed with long-time customers, food critics, and local business owners.

The excitement was palpable as Maria proudly showcased her revamped menu, featuring fresh pasta made daily and hand-picked ingredients from local farms. However, just as the festivities were heating up, a rival restaurateur, James, arrived, complaining about alleged noise pollution stemming from the event.

Maria had never seen James before, but he claimed to live nearby and was fed up with the sounds of laughter, music, and clinking glasses. James filed a noise complaint with the town authorities, insisting that the noise was disrupting his peaceful evening routine.

The principle of typicality comes into play here. The court ruled in favor of Maria, citing that the allegations of noise pollution were not typical of the usual diners at Bella Vita. The court concluded that James' neighborhood was not peacefully quiet, as was commonly accepted in Willow Creek, and that the noise from the reunion was no more significant than the chatter and laughter of any usual Friday night in town.

This story illustrates the principle of typicality, which states that a legal action must be typical in terms of the affected circumstances, and not an outlier or extreme case. In this scenario, the noise from Maria's restaurant was deemed not atypically loud, as it was commensurate with the normal atmosphere of a bustling Friday night in Willow Creek. The court's decision exemplifies the principle of typicality, where the usual or common circumstances of the community serve as the benchmark to resolve the dispute."
Privity	"Privity is a common law doctrine that governed the liability and obligations of contracting parties. Once an important concept in contract law, these relationships and obligations now fall within the scope of modern statutory laws, diminishing its relevance to modern proceedings.

"	"The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the newly constructed Grand Avenue. It was a symbol of progress, a testament to the town's booming economy. But amidst the excitement, a dispute was brewing.

Tom, a local contractor, had been hired by the town's commission to build the new streetlights. He in turn had subcontracted with his friend, Alex, a skilled electrician, to handle the installation. The original contract between Tom and the town didn't mention anything about the subcontracting agreement between Tom and Alex.

As Tom was finishing up the project, he received a letter from the town, complaining about the poor workmanship of the streetlights. They demanded that Tom fix the issue, or else they would terminate the contract. Tom was caught off guard, having assumed that his responsibility ended with completing the project.

With no clear contractual agreement between Tom and the town, Tom turned to Alex, asking him to fix the issue. However, Alex refused, citing the original contract between Tom and him, which only specified his role in installing the streetlights. The dispute highlighted the limitations of privity, where the obligations and liabilities of contracting parties were narrowly defined, leaving outsiders like the town as non-party beneficiaries with limited recourse.

In this scenario, the town, as a non-party beneficiary, had limited legal recourse due to the doctrine of privity. The dispute ultimately led to a stalemate, as neither Tom nor Alex was willing to take on the responsibility of fixing the streetlights. The incident served as a reminder of the limitations of privity and the importance of clear contractual agreements in modern contract law."
Privity of contract	"The doctrine of privity of contract is a common law principle which provides that a contract cannot confer rights or impose obligations upon anyone who is not a party to that contract. It is related to, but distinct from, the doctrine of consideration, according to which a promise is legally enforceable only if valid consideration has been provided for it, and a plaintiff is legally entitled to enforce such a promise only if they are a promisee from whom the consideration has moved.
A principal consequence of the doctrine of privity is that, at common law, a third party generally has no right to enforce a contract to which they are not a party, even where that contract was entered into by the contracting parties specifically for their benefit and with a common intention among all of them that they should be able to enforce it.  In England & Wales and Northern Ireland, the doctrine has been substantially weakened by the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, which created a statutory exception to privity, providing, in certain circumstances, third parties the right to enforce terms of contracts to which they are not privy."	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of privity of contract:

Emily's parents promised to co-sign a loan to help their son, David, buy a home. The loan contract was made directly between the bank and David. However, Emily and her parents maintained that they had intended for the loan contract to benefit them too, as they would be using their assets to secure the loan and were assuming some financial risk. Nonetheless, the Bank told them that the contract only between the bank and David, and they had ""privity of contract"" with David, not with them.

When David fell behind on payments, Emily and her parents offered to help by making mortgage payments to the Bank. However, the bank refused, stating that Emily and her parents were not parties to the contract. They had no right to modify the contract and no liability to repay David for the loan, despite their financial interests.

This story highlights one of the key consequences of privity of contract, which is related to the enforceability of a contract amongst third parties, or non-signatories. While it seems intuitively reasonable to expect David's parents, Emily and her husband, to be allowed to help out, as they provided financial support, this isn't the case in England and Wales, since their promises and undertakings did not affect any contractual duties at all outside of the contract between David and the bank."
Proper law	"The doctrine of the proper law is applied in the choice of law stage of a lawsuit involving the conflict of laws.
When the jurisdiction is in dispute, one or more state laws will be relevant to the decision-making process. If the laws are the same, this will cause no problems, but if there are substantive differences, the choice of which law to apply will produce a different judgment. Each state, therefore, produces a set of rules to guide the choice of law, and one of the most significant rules is that the law to be applied in any given situation will be the proper law. This is the law that seems to have the closest and most real connection to the facts of the case, and so has the best claim to be applied. The term ""proper"" refers back to the older English sense as being ""proper to"". In other words, the law proper to the contract or the contractual term or issue involved.
All laws, to a greater or lesser extent, are reflections of the public policies of the state that enacted them. The more important the policy to the society, the greater the claim of the relevant law to be applied. Thus, if laws exist to protect citizens, the law of the place where loss or damage is sustained might have a strong claim to apply: e.g. in a traffic accident, two cars collide because of faulty maintenance and both drivers are injured – the local laws exist to provide some degree of protection for all those who use the roads in that state, setting minimum standards for the design and maintenance of vehicles, specifying what levels of insurance should be carried, setting the minimum age and qualifications for the right to drive, etc.
But the problem with accepting the claim of anyone state to have its law apply is that the result may be somewhat arbitrary. So, in the example given, if neither driver had a residence in the state, and the cars were both maintained outside the state, the laws of other states may have an equal or better claim to apply. The advantage of the proper law approach is that it builds in flexibility rather than offering a mechanical rule. Suppose that there is a contract between an Italian company and an English partnership for the sale of goods made in Greece to be shipped from Belgium on a ship flying the flag of Panama to a Swedish port. Adopting a rule such as the lex loci contractus, i.e. apply the law of the place where the contract was made, might actually select a law having no other connection with the substance of the bargain made by the parties. Similarly, picking the lex loci solutionis, i.e. the law of the place where the contract is to be performed, may prove to be equally irrelevant, assuming that there is only one place where performance is to occur: in the example, there is manufacture in Greece, delivery to Belgium, loading in Belgium, carriage on the high seas, and unloading in Sweden. So, if the contract does not make an express selection of the law to apply (see the choice of law clause), the parties are deemed to have chosen to be bound by the law with which the contract has the closest and most real connection.
The general rule is that the proper law is the primary system of law that governs most aspects of the factual situation giving rise to the dispute. This does not imply that all the aspects of the factual circumstances are necessarily governed by the same system of law, but there is a strong presumption that this will be the case (see characterization). So, the process of legal analysis undertaken by the courts in each case identifies all the facts that have a specific geographical connection, e.g. where the parties reside or their businesses operate, where an agreement was made, where relevant actions were performed, etc. Once all the relevant connecting factors have been identified, the law of the state that has the greatest number of connections will be the proper law. In the event of a tie, the connecting factors which relate to performance will be given greater weight than the connecting factors affect form. In most cases, this weighting will produce a clear winner."	"Maria's Art Studio, owned by an Italian artist, manufactured beautiful paintings in Greece using traditional techniques. She had a contract with Sweden's Dreamcatcher Gallery to deliver 50 of these paintings. The paintings would be shipped from Belgium, where Maria had a storage facility, and transported by a ship flying the Panamanian flag.

As Maria's delivery team loaded the paintings onto the ship in Belgium, an unexpected storm hit the port, causing some of the paintings to be damaged. The Dreamcatcher Gallery hired a lawyer in Sweden to file a lawsuit against Maria's Art Studio in Italy, claiming damages for the destroyed artwork.

Italian law might seem relevant to the case, as Maria's Art Studio is based in Italy. However, Swedish law also has connections to the case, since the contract was made in Sweden and the damage occurred during the shipping process, which had Swedish jurisdiction. Panamanian law might also be relevant, as the ship's flag is from Panama.

In this situation, the court will apply the doctrine of the proper law to determine which jurisdiction should govern the dispute. The court will look at all the connecting factors, such as where the parties reside, where the contract was made, where relevant actions were performed, and so on. In this case, the law with the closest and most real connection to the facts would likely be Swedish law, as the contract was made in Sweden and the damage occurred during the shipping process."
Proportionality (law)	"Proportionality is a general principle in law which covers several separate (although related) concepts:

The concept of proportionality is used as a criterion of fairness and justice in statutory interpretation processes, especially in constitutional law, as a logical method intended to assist in discerning the correct balance between the restriction imposed by a corrective measure and the severity of the nature of the prohibited act.
Within criminal law, the concept is used to convey the idea that the punishment of an offender should fit the crime.
Under international humanitarian law governing the legal use of force in an armed conflict, proportionality and distinction are important factors in assessing military necessity.
Under the United Kingdom's Civil Procedure Rules, costs must be ""proportionately and reasonably incurred"", or ""proportionate and reasonable in amount"", if they are to form part of a court ruling on costs."	"Sarah was a passionate environmental activist who had been advocating for stricter regulations on polluters in her community. One day, she stumbled upon a major pharmaceutical company dumping toxic waste in a nearby stream. Enraged, she organized a group of like-minded individuals to protest the company's actions.

The company, trying to maintain its reputation, filed a lawsuit against Sarah and her group, claiming that their protests were interfering with their business operations. The judge was tasked with determining whether the company's requested injunction was reasonable.

In deliberating, the judge applied the principle of proportionality. She considered the severity of the company's alleged harm (the pollution) and weighed it against the severity of the restriction being imposed on Sarah and her group (the injunction). The judge found that the company's business operations couldn't be significantly impacted by temporary noise and disruptions, while a permanent injunction might cripple the activists' ability to advocate for their cause.

The judge decided that a more proportionate solution would be to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) allowing the protests to continue, but limiting them to specific times and areas. This solution maintained the balance between the company's right to operate and the activists' right to free speech.

The story illustrates the concept of proportionality by showing how a judge weighs the severity of the issue against the severity of the solution to ensure fairness and justice."
Prosecutorial discretion	"In common law, the principle of prosecutorial discretion allows public prosecutors a wide latitude to decide whether or not to charge a person for a crime, and which charges to file. A similar principle in continental law countries is called the principle of opportunity.
There is a divide between countries where prosecutions are generally discretionary and where prosecutions are mandatory (known as the legality principle or compulsory prosecution). In addition, in some countries prosecutors operate independently with more discretion vs in a hierarchical system that require more conformity.
Countries following civil-law are predominately based on the principal of compulsory prosecution, although the principle of opportunity is encoded in law in the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Slovenia, Belgian law and France. Some similar provisions exist in and in Estonian law."	"Sarah was pulled over by the police for speeding on the highway. The officer, after checking her license and registering her vehicle, informed her that she was going 15 miles per hour over the speed limit. Sarah was worried that she would be in trouble, but the officer explained that she was lucky because she was a first-time offender and the speed limit was well-marked.

The officer handed Sarah a warning notice, citing her for the infraction. However, Sarah's state has a statute that requires prosecutors to criminally charge anyone caught speeding more than 10 miles per hour over the limit. The DA's office receives the case and it's assigned to a young prosecutor named Emily.

Emily reviews Sarah's file and notes that this is her first offense, and that she's remorseful and apologetic. Emily decides to exercise prosecutorial discretion and does not charge Sarah with a crime. Instead, she offers Sarah a plea deal, allowing her to complete a defensive driving course to avoid any points on her license or fines.

The reason for Emily's decision is not because she thinks the laws don't apply to Sarah, but because she believes that the system should prioritize rehabilitation over punishment. Emily's discretion allows her to focus on more serious cases and to give Sarah a second chance. In this scenario, Emily is exercising her discretion to allocate limited judicial resources, prioritizing public safety and fairness.

This real-life scenario illustrates the concept of prosecutorial discretion, where a prosecutor can choose not to pursue a case, even if the law technically applies, based on the individual circumstances of the case."
Proximate cause	"In law and insurance, a proximate cause is an event sufficiently related to an injury that the courts deem the event to be the cause of that injury.  There are two types of causation in the law: cause-in-fact, and proximate (or legal) cause. Cause-in-fact is determined by the ""but for"" test: But for the action, the result would not have happened. (For example, but for running the red light, the collision would not have occurred.) The action is a necessary condition, but may not be a sufficient condition, for the resulting injury. A few circumstances exist where the but-for test is ineffective (see But-for test below). Since but-for causation is very easy to show (but for stopping to tie your shoe, you would not have missed the train and would not have been mugged), a second test is used to determine if an action is close enough to a harm in a ""chain of events"" to be legally valid. This test is called proximate cause. Proximate cause is a key principle of insurance and is concerned with how the loss or damage actually occurred. There are several competing theories of proximate cause (see Other factors). For an act to be deemed to cause a harm, both tests must be met; proximate cause is a legal limitation on cause-in-fact.
The formal Latin term for ""but for"" (cause-in-fact) causation, is sine qua non causation."	"Here is a story that illustrates the concept of proximate cause:

Meet Emily, a busy working mom who lives in a snug little house on a quiet suburban street. One weekend morning, Emily decides to host a brunch for a group of friends and decides to burn some bacon in the oven while she gets the pancakes cooking on the stovetop. As she's flipping the pancakes, the fire alarm goes off because of the burning bacon, filling the house with smoke. Emily rushes to open a window to get some ventilation, but in her haste, she accidentally leaves the window open while she rushes to put out the fire, allowing a strong gust of wind to blow into the house.

The strong wind blows in through the open window and sends a nearby bird's nest crashing to the ground, injuring a young jogger who happened to be running by. The jogger has a traumatic brain injury and is unable to work for several months, suing Emily for the damages.

Now, it's clear that the burning of the bacon (but-for) caused the fire alarm to go off. But, it's not just the burning of the bacon that directly caused the injury. The wind, the open window, and the bird's nest all contributed to the injury. To get compensation, Emily's insurance company will argue that the burning of the bacon was the proximate cause of the injury – a sufficient condition to deem the initial event to be the cause of the injury. But for the fire alarm, the injury might not have occurred; however, without the wind, the open window, and the bird's nest, it can be argued that the chain of events might have been broken, and the injury would not have occurred."
Public policy doctrine	"In private international law, the public policy doctrine or ordre public (French: lit. ""public order"") concerns the body of principles that underpin the operation of legal systems in each state. This addresses the social, moral and economic values that tie a society together: values that vary in different cultures and change over time. Law regulates behaviour either to reinforce existing social expectations or to encourage constructive change, and laws are most likely to be effective when they are consistent with the most generally accepted societal norms and reflect the collective morality of the society.
In performing this function, Cappalli has suggested that the critical values of any legal system include impartiality, neutrality, certainty, equality, openness, flexibility, and growth. This assumes that a state's courts function as dispute resolution systems, which avoid the violence that often otherwise accompanies private resolution of disputes. That is, citizens have to be encouraged to use the court system to resolve their disputes. The more certain and predictable the outcome of a court action, the less incentive there is to go to court where a loss is probable. But certainty must be subject to the needs of individual justice, hence the development of equity.
A judge should always consider the underlying policies to determine whether a rule should be applied to a specific factual dispute. If laws are applied too strictly and mechanically, the law cannot keep pace with social innovation. Similarly, if there is an entirely new situation, a return to the policies forming the basic assumptions underpinning potentially relevant rules of law identifies the best guidelines for resolving the immediate dispute. Over time, these policies evolve, becoming more clearly defined and more deeply embedded in the legal system."	"Maria's Law Firm represented a local politician, Juan, who was being sued by a resident, Emma, for declined a permit to operate a local food cart in a public park. Juan argued that Emma's cart infringed on the city's regulations, which prohibited food carts within a certain radius of existing restaurants. However, Emma's cart was a mobile kitchen serving meals to low-income families, which was clearly a social benefit to the community.

Maria reviewed the case and decided to submit an argument under the public policy doctrine. She argued that the city's regulations should be interpreted in light of the underlying values of the community. In this case, the value of promoting access to healthy food for low-income families weighed more heavily than the city's commercial interests. She cited a recent public health initiative aiming to increase access to nutritious food options for marginalized communities.

The judge agreed, ruling that the decision to grant or deny permits should be guided by a nuanced understanding of the community's needs and values, rather than a strict application of the law. The court found that Emma's food cart was in fact contributing to the community's well-being and tipped the scales in her favor. The judge ruled in favor of Emma, stating that the community's values, as reflected in its public policies, took precedence over the strict technical interpretation of the regulations.

This decision reflects the public policy doctrine's aim to values-driven decision-making, recognizing that laws in practice should embody and reflect societal values rather than remain inflexible and unresponsive to social needs."
Public trust doctrine	The public trust doctrine is the principle that the sovereign holds in trust for public use some resources such as shoreline between the high and low tide lines, regardless of private property ownership.	"The sun was setting over the small coastal town of Tidal Cove, casting a warm orange glow over the bustling harbor. Locals and tourists alike flocked to the waterfront to enjoy the final rays of the sun, and to gaze out at the calm sea.

The town's shoreline, however, was a contentious issue. Over the years, developers had sought to build luxury condos and hotels along the waterfront, claiming that the land was private property and they had the right to develop it as they saw fit.

But the townspeople knew better. They had always claimed that the shoreline, known as the ""tidal zone,"" was held in trust by the government for the public's benefit. They argued that the land itself was a natural resource, and that the public had a right to access and enjoy it for recreational purposes, such as swimming, fishing, and sailing.

The conflict came to a head when a local businessman, Richard, announced plans to build a high-rise hotel on the very spot where the townspeople liked to gather to watch the sunset. The townspeople, led by a feisty retiree named Mary, rallied together to stop Richard's plans.

Their argument was simple: the tidal zone was not just private property to be developed for profit, but a public treasure to be preserved for the benefit of all. And the court ultimately agreed, ruling that the shoreline was indeed held in trust by the government for public use, and that Richard's plans were illegal. The townspeople cheered, knowing that their beloved shoreline was forever protected for generations to come."
Purcell principle	"In United States law, the Purcell principle is the doctrine that courts should not change election rules too close to an election, because of the risk of causing confusion. It is named after Purcell v. Gonzalez, a 2006 case from the U.S. Supreme Court's emergency docket, or shadow docket. It is frequently invoked by the Supreme Court and lower courts to allow elections to proceed under a state's preferred voting requirements, maps, and other rules.
The term ""Purcell principle"" was introduced in a 2016 law review article by Richard L. Hasen. It has also appeared in opinions by the justices themselves."	"It was August, just a month before the local mayoral election in the small town of Oakdale. The election was shaping up to be a tight race, with the incumbent mayor, John, facing off against a challenger, Maria. Just as things were heating up, the Oakdale City Council voted to change the voting system from traditional paper ballots to electronic voting machines.

The change was meant to speed up the voting process, but not everyone was pleased. Maria's campaign accused the council of trying to manipulate the election in John's favor. As a result, confusion spread throughout the town, with some voters wondering if they needed to register again or update their voter information. Local election officials were flooded with calls and emails seeking clarification.

Just as the controversy was gaining momentum, the Oakdale County Court received an emergency petition from Maria's campaign, asking the court to block the electronic voting system from being used. The judge, ruling in accordance with the Purcell principle, decided not to intervene. Citing the proximity of the election and the potential for widespread confusion, the judge allowed the election to proceed under the original voting rules.

In the end, the election went forward with paper ballots, and despite some initial hiccups, the voting process went relatively smoothly. Maria's campaign had its concerns, but the court's decision allowed the election to take place without further disruption. The Purcell principle had ensured that the election could proceed without undue interference, preserving the integrity of the democratic process."
Qualified immunity	"In the United States, qualified immunity is a legal principle of federal law that grants government officials performing discretionary (optional) functions immunity from lawsuits for damages unless the plaintiff shows that the official violated ""clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known"". It is comparable to sovereign immunity, though it protects government employees rather than the government itself. It is less strict than absolute immunity, by protecting officials who ""make reasonable but mistaken judgments about open legal questions"", extending to ""all [officials] but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law"". Qualified immunity applies only to government officials in civil litigation, and does not protect the government itself from suits arising from officials' actions.
The U.S. Supreme Court first introduced the qualified immunity doctrine in Pierson v. Ray (1967), a case litigated during the height of the civil rights movement. It is stated to have been originally introduced with the rationale of protecting law enforcement officials from frivolous lawsuits and financial liability in cases where they acted in good faith in unclear legal situations. Starting around 2005, courts increasingly applied the doctrine to cases involving the use of excessive or deadly force by police, leading to widespread criticism that it ""has become a nearly failsafe tool to let police brutality go unpunished and deny victims their constitutional rights"" (as summarized in a 2020 Reuters report)."	"Meet Officer Johnson, a dedicated police officer with a strong sense of duty to protect his community. One day, he responds to a distress call at a local convenience store, where a robbery is in progress. Upon arrival, he sees a suspect, John, attempting to escape with the cash register. Officer Johnson chases John down the street, but during the pursuit, John suddenly jumps into a nearby alleyway and starts rummaging through a nearby trash can.

Officer Johnson, fearing for his safety and the public's safety, decides to use his baton to subdue John. However, during the struggle, John suffers a serious injury. The victim sues Officer Johnson, claiming that his use of force was excessive and violated John's Fourth Amendment rights.

Under the qualified immunity doctrine, Officer Johnson's defense is not liable for damages unless it can be shown that his actions were unreasonable and in violation of clearly established law. Officer Johnson's lawyers argue that, given the circumstances, a reasonable officer would have believed that the use of force was necessary to protect themselves and others from harm. Since the law at the time didn't clearly establish that Officer Johnson's actions were unreasonable, he is entitled to qualified immunity and is not liable for damages.

In this scenario, Officer Johnson's actions were made in good faith, and he acted reasonably given the uncertain circumstances. However, if it were later found that Officer Johnson's actions were unjustified or in clear disregard of John's rights, he would not have qualified immunity and could be held liable."
Quantum meruit	"Quantum meruit is a Latin phrase meaning ""what one has earned"". In the context of contract law, it means something along the lines of ""reasonable value of services"".
In the United States, the elements of quantum meruit are determined by state common law. For example, to state a claim for unjust enrichment in New York, a plaintiff must allege that (1) defendant was enriched; (2) the enrichment was at plaintiff's expense; and (3) the circumstances were such that equity and good conscience require defendants to make restitution.

Quantum meruit is the measure of damages where an express contract is mutually modified by the implied agreement of the parties, or not completed. While there is often confusion between the concept of quantum meruit and that of ""unjust enrichment"" of one party at the expense of another, the two concepts are distinct.
Situation:
The concept of quantum meruit applies in (but is not limited to) the following set of situations:

When a person hires another to do work, but an impeding act falling short of vitiating frustration/repudiation has occurred, such as access or intervening act of God, the worker may sue (or counter-sue) for the value of the improvements made/services rendered. The law implies a promise from the employer to the worker that they will pay them for their services, as much as they may deserve or merit.The measure of value set forth in a contract is legally admissible as evidence of the value of the improvements or services but the court (or thus out of court settlement) is not required to use the contract's terms when calculating a quantum meruit award. (This is because the values set forth in the contract are rebuttable, meaning the one who ultimately may have to pay the award can contest the value of services set in the contract.)
When there is an express contract for a stipulated amount and mode of compensation for services, the plaintiff cannot abandon the contract and resort to an action for a quantum meruit on an implied assumpsit. However, if there is absence of any promised consideration, the plaintiff (such as hirer) has a right to elect to repudiate the contract and, failing a valid frustration, innocent mistake reason or similar defense, has the right to compensation from the defendant on a quantum meruit basis."	"The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek as contractor, Jack Harris, finished up the landscaping job his neighbors, the Watsons, had hired him for. The yard looked beautiful, with a new patio, manicured grass, and vibrant flowers. Jack had worked tirelessly for three days, pouring his heart and soul into the project.

However, just as Jack was about to hand over the final bill, a sudden storm rolled in, knocking down a large branch from the Watsons' ancient oak tree. The branch landed squarely on Jack's newly laid patio, destroying a large section of it. The Watsons, understandably shaken, didn't want to pay Jack for the work he had done.

Feeling frustrated and shortchanged, Jack decided to take a different approach. He decided to sue the Watsons for the reasonable value of the work he had done, or ""quantum meruit."" Jack's lawyer argued that the Watsons had benefited from the improvements Jack had made to their property, and it would be unjust for them not to compensate him.

In the end, the judge agreed with Jack, ruling that the Watsons owed him for the reasonable value of the work he had done. The court ultimately decided that the value was higher than the original contract price, due to the extra time and effort Jack had put in to complete the project.

The story highlights how quantum meruit can come into play when an express contract is impacted by unforeseen circumstances, leaving a party without a clear remedy."
Qui facit per alium facit per se	"Qui facit per alium facit per se (anglicised Late Latin), which means ""He who acts through another does the act himself"", is a fundamental legal maxim of the law of agency. It is a maxim often stated in discussing the liability of employer for the act of employee in terms of vicarious liability."" 
According to this maxim, if in the nature of things, the master is obliged to perform the duties by employing servants, he is responsible for their act in the same way that he is responsible for his own acts.
The maxim is a shortened form of the fuller 18th-century formulation: qui facit per alium, est perinde ac si facit per se ipsum: ""whoever acts through another acts as if he were doing it himself.""
Indirectly, the principle is in action or present in the duty that has been represented by the agent so the duty performed will be seen as the performance of the agent himself. Whatever a principal can do for himself, can be done through an agent. The exception to this maxim would be acts of personal nature."	"Meet Sarah, the owner of a small boutique called ""Trendy Tees."" She employed a sales associate named Alex to help her run the store. One day, a customer, Emma, came to the store to return a shirt that didn't fit well. Alex, frustrated with the customer's constant requests for refunds, grew impatient and forcefully snatched the shirt from Emma's hands.

Emma was shocked and hurt by Alex's behavior and immediately reported the incident to Sarah. Sarah was devastated and fired Alex on the spot. Emma, however, wanted to take the matter further and sued Sarah, claiming that her employee's actions were a direct result of Sarah's poor management.

Sarah claimed that Alex was an independent contractor and she should not be held liable for his actions. But the judge disagreed. The court applied the principle of ""Qui facit per alium facit per se"", stating that Sarah was responsible for Alex's actions because, in the nature of her business, she was obliged to employ sales associates like Alex to run her store. According to the court, Sarah had the power to hire, train, and supervise her employees, and therefore, was vicariously liable for Alex's behavior.

Sarah's argument that Alex was an independent contractor was rejected. The judge ruled that Sarah was responsible for Alex's actions, as if she had done it herself. This ruling was a stark reminder that employers are accountable for the actions of their employees, even if they are not directly involved."
Reasonable doubt	"Beyond (a) reasonable doubt is a legal standard of proof required to validate a criminal conviction in most adversarial legal systems. It is a higher standard of proof than the standard of balance of probabilities (US English: preponderance of the evidence) commonly used in civil cases, reflecting the principle that in criminal cases the stakes are significantly higher: a person found guilty can be deprived of liberty or, in extreme cases, life itself, in addition to the collateral consequences and social stigma attached to conviction. The prosecution bears the burden of presenting compelling evidence that establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; if the trier of fact is not convinced to that standard, the accused is entitled to an acquittal. Originating in part from the principle sometimes called Blackstone's ratio—“It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer”—the standard is now widely accepted in criminal justice systems throughout common law jurisdictions.

"	"As the sun set over the small town, Detective James reviewed the evidence in the Smith murder case. The victim, a 35-year-old wife and mother, had been found stabbed multiple times in her home. The prime suspect was her husband, John, who had a history of domestic violence against his wife.

The prosecution had gathered a wealth of physical evidence, including a bloody fingerprint on the knife and a suspicious conversation between John and a friend captured on wiretap. However, detective James knew that the evidence was circumstantial and didn't prove John's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

As he walked to the courtroom, he couldn't shake off the feeling that there was something off. The detective's gut told him that John was guilty, but he couldn't pinpoint a specific piece of evidence that conclusively linked him to the crime. The defense attorney, Mrs. Thompson, sensing James's unease, began to question the reliability of the fingerprint evidence.

The jury deliberated for hours, weighing the evidence against John. Despite the strong circumstantial case, James knew he couldn't convince them to convict John beyond a reasonable doubt. The detective felt a pang of disappointment as the jury delivered a verdict of not guilty.

John was acquitted, and the community was left to grapple with the reality that the murderer was still at large. But Detective James knew that he had done his job to the best of his ability, ensuring that justice was done by not convicting an innocent man. As he walked out of the courtroom, he couldn't help but think of the truth in the words of William Blackstone: ""It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer."""
Reasonable person	"In law, a reasonable person or reasonable man is a hypothetical person whose character and care conduct, under any common set of facts, is decided through reasoning of good practice or policy. It is a legal fiction crafted by the courts and communicated through case law and jury instructions. In some practices, for circumstances arising from an uncommon set of facts, this person represents a composite of a relevant community's judgement as to how a typical member of that community should behave in situations that might pose a threat of harm (through action or inaction) to the public.
The reasonable person is used as a tool to standardize, teach law students, or explain the law to a jury. The reasonable person belongs to a family of hypothetical figures in law including: the ""right-thinking member of society"", the ""officious bystander"", the ""reasonable parent"", the ""reasonable landlord"", the ""fair-minded and informed observer"", the ""person having ordinary skill in the art"" in patent law. Ancient predecessors of the reasonable person include the bonus pater familias (the good family father) of ancient Rome,  the bonus vir (the good man) and spoudaios (the earnest person) in ancient Greece as well as the geru maa (the silent person) in ancient Egypt.  
While there is a loose consensus on its meaning in black letter law, there is no accepted technical definition, and the ""reasonable person"" is an emergent concept of common law. The reasonable person is not an average person or a typical person, leading to difficulties in applying the concept in some criminal cases, especially in regard to the partial defence of provocation. Most recently, Valentin Jeutner has argued that it matters less whether the reasonable person is reasonable, officious or diligent but rather that the most important characteristic of the reasonable person is that they are another person. As with legal fiction in general, it is somewhat susceptible to ad hoc manipulation or transformation. Strictly according to the fiction, it is misconceived for a party to seek evidence from actual people to establish how someone would have acted or what he would have foreseen. However, changes in the standard may be ""learned"" by high courts over time if there is a compelling consensus of public opinion.
The standard also holds that each person owes a duty to behave as a reasonable person would under the same or similar circumstances. While the specific circumstances of each case will require varying kinds of conduct and degrees of care, the reasonable person standard undergoes no variation itself. The standard does not exist independently of other circumstances within a case that could affect an individual's judgement. In cases resulting in judgment notwithstanding verdict, a vetted jury's composite judgment can be deemed beyond that of the reasonable person, and thus overruled.
The ""reasonable person"" construct can be found applied in many areas of the law.  The standard performs a crucial role in determining negligence in both criminal law—that is, criminal negligence—and tort law. The standard is also used in contract law, to determine contractual intent, or (when there is a duty of care) whether there has been a breach of the standard of care. The intent of a party can be determined by examining the understanding of a reasonable person, after consideration is given to all relevant circumstances of the case including the negotiations, any practices the parties have established between themselves, usages and any subsequent conduct of the parties. During the Nuremberg Trials, Sir David Maxwell Fyfe introduced the standard of the reasonable person to international law. Nowadays known as the standard of the 'reasonable military commander', international courts use it to assess the conduct of military officers in times of war."	"It was a sunny Saturday afternoon in a quiet suburban neighborhood. Tom, a friendly retiree, was working in his backyard, tending to his garden. His neighbor, Sarah, was hosting a barbecue in her yard, and the smell of sizzling burgers wafted over to Tom's property. Tom, enjoying the pleasant afternoon, decided to invite himself over to join the party.

As he made his way through the open gate separating their yards, he accidentally let his noisy dog, Max, off his leash. Max, excited by the commotion, chased after a ball and ran directly into Sarah's backyard grill, knocking over a tray of hot coals. The grill caught fire, and the flames quickly spread to other parts of the yard.

Sarah was understandably upset and held Tom responsible for the damages to her property and, worse, the start of the fire. In court, Tom's defense lawyer argued that Tom had not realized the potential danger of letting Max loose and couldn't foresee the accident. Yet, the judge responded that a reasonable person in Tom's position would have anticipated that letting a rambunctious dog off-leash in a densely populated neighborhood could result in harm to others.

The judge understood that accidents can happen, but held Tom accountable for failing to exercise the common sense that the 'reasonable person' would. The judge emphasized that the law applies standards by which the community judges an individual's conduct. Tom, by not being prudent when allowing his dog off-leash, had set a higher risk of danger, especially when the potential damage to Sarah's property could have been foreseen by a reasonable person."
Reasonableness	"The concept of reasonableness has two related meanings in law and political theory:

As a legal norm, it is used ""for the assessment of such matters as actions, decisions, and persons, rules and institutions, [and] also arguments and judgments.""
As a regulative idea, it ""requires... that all factors that might be relevant in answering a practical question be considered and... that they be assembled in a correct relation to each other in order to justify [a judgement].""
Reasonableness should not be conflated with rationality."	"Meet Sarah, a busy professional who owns a small bakery in a quaint town. She's known for her scrumptious pastries and warm personality. One day, the town council announces a new ordinance requiring all food vendors to install industrial ventilation systems to reduce noise pollution. Sarah is faced with a dilemma: the system would cost her $5,000, which would eat into her already-thin profits.

As Sarah weighs her options, she considers the impact on her business, the noise complaints from neighboring residents, and the council's reasoning behind the ordinance. She decides to contest the rule, citing a study that suggests the noise levels from her bakery are within acceptable limits and that installing the system would put her out of business.

The judge hearing the case considers Sarah's arguments and those of the council. In determining whether the council's decision is reasonable, the judge weighs all relevant factors, including the noise levels, the costs to Sarah's business, and the potential benefits to the community. The judge finds that while Sarah's concerns are valid, the council's decision is reasonable given the overall goal of reducing noise pollution.

In this scenario, reasonableness is applied to determine whether the council's decision was justified. The judge considers all relevant factors, assembling them in a correct relation to each other to evaluate whether the decision was reasonable. Reasonableness is not about being perfectly rational, but rather about considering all the relevant information and making a fair and just decision."
Remoteness in English law	"In English law, remoteness between a cause of action and the loss or damage sustained as a result is addressed through a set of rules in both tort and contract, which limit the amount of compensatory damages available for a wrong.
In negligence, the test of causation not only requires that the defendant was the cause in fact, but also requires that the loss or damage sustained by the claimant was not too remote. As with the policy issues in establishing that there was a duty of care and that that duty was breached, remoteness is designed as a further limit on a cause of action to ensure that the liability to pay damages placed on the defendant is done fairly.

"	"Alex, a keen environmentalist, often took his family on hiking trips to enjoy the great outdoors. One sunny Saturday, they decided to visit a popular trail near their hometown. As they were ascending a steep slope, they stumbled upon a signposted crossing over a small stream. There was no visible infrastructure to traverse the stream, and Alex, assuming it was a designated path, instructed his children to follow him through the shallow water.

Unbeknownst to Alex, a landslide had occurred just hours before, disrupting the streambed and creating a temporary pond. As they attempted to cross, one of his children slipped and fell, getting soaked and bruised. The family eventually made it to the other side, shaken but unharmed.

Weeks later, Alex received a letter from the local council, apologizing for the neglect in repairing the stream crossing and offering to compensate his child for the damages sustained. However, the compensation was limited to the immediate injuries and did not account for the subsequent stress and anxiety the child experienced as a result of the incident. Alex was dismayed by the reduction in damages and decided to consult a lawyer.

The lawyer explained that, although the council's negligence was the direct cause of the child's injury, the council was not liable for the stress and anxiety that followed as it was considered too remote from the initial event. The court's decision to limit damages was based on the principle of remoteness, which aims to ensure that the liability to pay damages is proportionate to the responsibility of the defendant and fair to all parties involved.

Alex understood that while the council still bore some responsibility, he could not expect full compensation for every possible outcome of their negligence. The court's decision struck a balance between holding the council accountable for their actions and avoiding excessive compensation that would be difficult to justify."
Res ipsa loquitur	"Res ipsa loquitur (Latin: ""the thing speaks for itself"") is a doctrine in common law and Roman-Dutch law jurisdictions under which a court can infer negligence from the very nature of an accident or injury in the absence of direct evidence on how any defendant behaved in the context of tort litigation. 
The crux of res ipsa loquitur is circumstantial inference. Although specific criteria differ by jurisdiction, an action typically must satisfy the following elements of negligence: the existence of a duty of care, breach of appropriate standard of care, causation, and injury. In res ipsa loquitur, the existence of the first three elements is inferred from the existence of injury that does not ordinarily occur without negligence."	"It was a sunny Saturday afternoon at the local golf course. Dr. Thompson, an accomplished golfer, had just had his morning round. Later that day, her friend, Sarah, decided to try out the driving range. While watching from the sidelines, Sarah witnessed an unusual accident. Rachel, a novice golfer, hit a golf ball, which landed behind a large net and wrapped its leash around a retired golfer's neck. The golfer stumbled, tripped, and fell on his elbow, injuring it severely.

Sarah approached Rachel, concerned, and inquired about her actions. Rachel explained that she had hit the ball, but denied intentionally aiming at the net or anyone. There were no witnesses to the incident or any dashcam to capture the ball's trajectory.

Rachel could claim the golf course is responsible, arguing the net should have been better positioned or secured since it caught the ball and caused the injury. Alternatively, the golf course could argue it wasn't their duty to prevent accidents with golf balls. However, the injury shouldn't have happened without someone's negligence being involved because the unusual event of a golf ball's leash getting tangled around a person's neck like it did points to neglect."
Res judicata	"Res judicata or res iudicata, also known as claim preclusion, is the Latin term for judged matter, and refers to either of two concepts in common law civil procedure: a case in which there has been a final judgment and that is no longer subject to appeal; and the legal doctrine meant to bar (or preclude) relitigation of a claim between the same parties.
In the case of res judicata, the matter cannot be raised again, either in the same court or in a different court. A court will use res judicata to deny reconsideration of a matter. The doctrine of res judicata is a method of preventing injustice to the parties of a case supposedly finished but perhaps also or mostly a way of avoiding unnecessary waste of judicial resources. Res judicata does not merely prevent future judgments from contradicting earlier ones, but also prevents litigants from multiplying judgments.
It is similar to the concept of double jeopardy and non bis in idem in criminal law, but the protection in criminal prosecutions only bars an identical prosecution for the same offense. However, a different offense may be charged on identical evidence at a second trial; whereas, res judicata precludes any causes of action or claims that may arise from the previously litigated subject matter."	"Sarah and Mike had a contentious relationship that ended after they reached a settlement agreement, which was approved by the court, three years ago. As part of the agreement, Sarah received a significant amount of alimony and shared custody of their young daughter.

Fast forward to today, Mike has fallen on hard times and is struggling to make ends meet. He is now insisting that Sarah, who has also experienced financial difficulties, should pay more in alimony to help him cover his expenses. Sarah is understandably upset and argues that the original agreement she and Mike signed was fair and should stand.

In court, Sarah's lawyer argues that the matter is res judicata, citing the final judgment and settlement agreement from three years ago. The judge agrees, citing the doctrine of res judicata, and rules that the matter is not open for further litigation. Mike's new claims are essentially a rehashing of the same issues that were already decided in the original case.

The judge explains that the concept of res judicata prevents the two parties from relitigating the same matter, even if circumstances have changed. Mike and Sarah agreed to the original settlement and it is now final. The court will not revisit the matter, even if Mike is now in a more difficult financial situation. The doctrine of res judicata ensures that the parties move on, rather than engaging in endless litigation."
Rescue doctrine	"In the USA, the rescue doctrine of the law of torts holds that if a tortfeasor creates a circumstance that places the tort victim in danger, the tortfeasor is liable not only for the harm caused to the victim, but also the harm caused to any person injured in an effort to rescue that victim. This doctrine was originally promulgated by Benjamin N. Cardozo in the 1921 case, Wagner v. Int'l Ry. Co. There, writing for the Court of Appeals of New York (which is the supreme court of that state), Cardozo stated: ""Danger invites rescue.  The cry of distress is the summons to relief [...] The emergency begets the man.  The wrongdoer may not have foreseen the coming of a deliverer.  He is accountable as if he had."" The rescue doctrine was established nineteen years later, in the landmark case of Cote v. Palmer.
Essentially, the rescue doctrine means that the rescuer can recover damages from a defendant when the rescuer is injured rescuing someone.  The defendant is usually negligent in causing the accident to occur.  Other cases have occurred where the plaintiff is injured rescuing the defendant and is able to collect damages. 
In Wagner v. International Railway, riders on the defendant's trains were allowed to walk between cars while the train was moving.  In one incident, a rider fell through the cars.  The plaintiff, trying to help the fallen rider, was injured himself.  The court found the defendant liable because of negligence to allow riders to walk between cars while the train was moving. The aforementioned example is a reference to the concept that Danger invites Rescue. Whoever caused the accident will be liable for any subsequent accident which develops as a result of the original accident. 
Essentially, in its pure form the Rescue Doctrine boils down to 4 main elements - all of which must be met in order to bring it to bear for the person asserting its privilege.

There must be peril or the appearance of peril to a third party, caused by the defendant.
That peril or appearance of peril must be imminent
A reasonable person would recognize the peril or appearance of peril and the plaintiff must also have actually recognized it.
The plaintiff must have exercised reasonable care in effecting the rescue."	"Sarah was driving home from work on a rainy evening when she saw a car submerged in a flooded ditch on the side of the road. The driver, unable to open his door, was frantically banging on the window, waving for help.

Feeling sympathy for the stranded driver, Sarah pulled over and got out of her car to assist him. As she waded into the water to try and open the door, she slipped and fell, injuring her ankle.

The driver, whose name was John, was shaken but unharmed. He had been speeding around a curve and lost control of his vehicle, leading to the accident.

Sarah filed a lawsuit against John, citing the Rescue doctrine. She argued that John's negligence in driving recklessly had created the situation that put her in danger, and that she was trying to rescue him when she was injured.

The court agreed, ruling that John was liable for the harm caused to Sarah. The judge noted that the peril or appearance of peril was imminent, as the driver was trapped in the car and struggling to free himself. A reasonable person would recognize the danger and, like Sarah, feel compelled to act to rescue the stranded driver.

Furthermore, the court found that Sarah had exercised reasonable care in effecting the rescue, as she had taken the necessary precautions to try and help John despite the dangerous conditions.

In the end, Sarah recovered damages for her injuries, and John was held accountable for the harm caused by his negligence. The Rescue doctrine applied, as the court concluded that John's initial wrongdoing had led to the subsequent harm caused to Sarah while she was trying to rescue him."
Respondeat superior	"Respondeat superior (Latin:  ""let the master answer""; plural:  respondeant superiores) is a doctrine that a party is responsible for (and has vicarious liability for) acts of his agents.: 794  For example, in the United States, there are circumstances when an employer is liable for acts of employees performed within the course of their employment.  This rule is also called the master-servant rule, recognized in both common law and civil law jurisdictions.
In a broader scope, respondeat superior is based upon the concept of vicarious liability.

"	"Here is a short story illustrating the concept of Respondeat Superior:

Emily worked as a customer service representative at a large retail store, Smith's Electronics. She was responsible for responding to customer complaints and resolving issues related to returns and exchanges. While at a store branch located in another city for a training session, Emily became upset with a customer who was pushing her for a refund for a damaged product. Frustrated with the customer, Emily lashed out, yelling at the customer and eventually reduced the refund to a significantly smaller amount.

The customer complained to the store's corporate office, who immediately launched an investigation into the incident. During the investigation, Emily revealed that she had been following the same procedure for handling returns that had been instructed by her supervisor at the training session. It was, however, acknowledged that the procedure had been wildly invalidly applied in this one case, resulting in discrimination.

Smith's Electronics corporation took swift action, not only to resolve the complaint with the customer but also to apologize, rectify its policies, and fire the manager who had given the training, and applied severe disciplinary actions against Emily, holding her responsible for her behavior toward the customer. Jong, the corporation's customer service manager, stated, 'employees who act in the scope of their employment don't act alone, their actions are reflective of the organization.'"
Restitution and unjust enrichment	"Restitution and unjust enrichment is the field of law relating to gains-based recovery. In contrast with damages (the law of compensation), restitution is a claim or remedy requiring a defendant to give up benefits wrongfully obtained. Liability for restitution is primarily governed by the ""principle of unjust enrichment"": A person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is required to make restitution.
This principle derives from late Roman law, as stated in the Latin maxim attributed to Sextus Pomponius, Jure naturae aequum est neminem cum alterius detrimentum et injuria fieri locupletiorem (""By natural law it is just that no one should be enriched by another's loss or injury""). In civil law systems, it is also referred to as enrichment without cause or unjustified enrichment.
In pre-modern English common law, restitutionary claims were often brought in an action for assumpsit and later in a claim for money had and received. The seminal case giving a general theory for when restitution would be available is Lord Mansfield's decision in Moses v Macferlan (1760), which imported into the common law notions of conscience from English chancery. Blackstone's Commentaries also endorsed this approach, citing Moses.
Where an individual is unjustly enriched, modern common law imposes an obligation upon the recipient to make restitution, subject to defences such as change of position and the protection of bona fide purchasers from contrary equitable title. Liability for an unjust enrichment arises irrespective of wrongdoing on the part of the recipient, though it may affect available remedies. And restitution can also be ordered for wrongs (also called ""waiver of tort"" because election of remedies historically occurred when first filing a suit). This may be treated as a distinct basis for restitution, or it may be treated as a subset of unjust enrichment.
Unjust enrichment is not to be confused with illicit enrichment, which is a legal concept referring to the enjoyment of an amount of wealth by a person that is not justified by reference to their lawful income."	"As the sun set over the quiet town of Willow Creek, 35-year-old Emma couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions. She had recently discovered that her former business partner, James, had secretly sold their jointly-owned company to a large corporation, without her knowledge or consent.

The irony wasn't lost on Emma - the company they had built from scratch was now worth millions, thanks largely to her innovative ideas and tireless efforts. Yet, she was left out of the deal and had lost her job in the process.

As she pondered her next move, Emma recalled a phrase she had learned in law school: ""Unjust Enrichment."" She had always thought it was just a fancy legal term, but now it seemed to be her only hope.

Unjust Enrichment, or as the Romans would have it, ""Jure naturae aequum est neminem cum alterius detrimentum et injuria fieri locupletiorem"", meant that whoever had gained an unjust benefit at another's expense should make restitution. It was a concept that resonated deeply with Emma, as she realized that James had clearly gained from her own toil and sweat.

With her mind made up, Emma decided to take James to court, seeking restitution for the unjust benefits he had derived from their partnership. The case would be fought on the basis of unjust enrichment, rather than through breach of contract or tort. Emma's goal was to reclaim her rightful share of the company's value, using the principle of unjust enrichment to ensure that James couldn't keep her hard-earned gains. As she walked out of the courthouse, Emma felt a sense of determination wash over her. She knew that justice would be served, and that James would be forced to relinquish his ill-gotten gains."
Reverse doctrine of equivalents	"The reverse doctrine of equivalents is a legal doctrine of United States patent law, according to which a device that appears to literally infringe a patent claim, by including elements or limitations that correspond to each element or limitation of the patent claim, nonetheless does not infringe the patent, because the accused device operates on a different principle. That is, ""it performs the same or a similar function in a substantially different way."" It has been said that ""the purpose of the 'reverse' doctrine is to prevent unwarranted extension of the claims beyond a fair scope of the patentee's invention."""	"Meet Emma, a talented chef who invented a revolutionary new way to cook perfect eggs. Her patent claim describes a kitchen device that uses a combination of microwave radiation and gentle air circulation to cook eggs precisely to any desired level of doneness. The claim specifies that the device must use microwaves to heat the eggs, and that the air circulation must be designed to prevent hotspots and ensure even cooking.

Years later, a rival chef, Michael, develops a competing egg-cooking device. Michael's device uses high-frequency sound waves to vibrate the eggs, causing them to cook quickly and evenly. While Michael's device appears to literally infringe Emma's patent claim, as it uses a combination of elements similar to those described in the patent claim (a means of heating and a means of air circulation), the competition's device operates on a different principle.

In court, Emma argues that Michael's device infringes her patent because it performs the same function as her device (cooking eggs perfectly). However, the judge finds that the reverse doctrine of equivalents applies. Although Michael's device includes elements similar to those described in the patent claim, it operates on a fundamentally different principle (using sound waves instead of microwaves). The judge rules that Emma's patent is not infringed, as Michael's device does not fall within the fair scope of the patentee's invention."
Rights	"Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory. Rights are an important concept in law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology.
The history of social conflicts has often involved attempts to define and redefine rights. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ""rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived""."	"Sarah was a single mother working two jobs to provide for her 7-year-old son, Max. She was tired, but determined to give him the best life possible. One day, she received an eviction notice from her landlord, citing a technicality in the lease agreement.

Sarah was devastated. Where would she and Max go? She couldn't afford a new place, and Max loved their current home, with its small backyard where he could play. She remembered a conversation with her friend, Emma, who was an advocate for tenants' rights. Emma had told Sarah that tenants had the right to privacy, and that the landlord couldn't simply evict them without just cause.

Sarah stood firm, refusing to leave her home without a fight. She contacted the local tenant advocacy group and they helped her gather evidence to dispute the eviction. The day of the court hearing arrived, and Sarah felt nervous but determined. The judge ruled in her favor, citing the tenant's right to privacy and the landlord's failure to provide adequate notice.

As Sarah and Max walked out of the courtroom, victorious, Sarah realized that rights were not just abstract concepts, but real, tangible powers that could protect people like her from exploitation. She felt empowered, knowing that she had asserted her right to a safe and stable home for her son. The experience taught her that rights were not just a abstract idea, but a living, breathing force that could make a real difference in people's lives."
Ripeness	"In United States law, ripeness refers to the readiness of a case for litigation; ""a claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all."" For example, if a law of ambiguous quality has been enacted but never applied, a case challenging that law lacks the ripeness necessary for a decision.
The goal is to prevent premature adjudication; if a dispute is insufficiently developed, any potential injury or stake is too speculative to warrant judicial action. Ripeness issues most usually arise when a plaintiff seeks anticipatory relief, such as an injunction. 
Originally stated in Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia Steamship Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration (1885), ripeness is one the seven rules of the constitutional avoidance doctrine established in Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority (1936) that requires that the Supreme Court of the United States to ""not 'anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it.'"" The Court fashioned a two-part test for assessing ripeness challenges to federal regulations. The case is often applied to constitutional challenges to federal and state statutes as well. The Court said in Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136 (1967):

Without undertaking to survey the intricacies of the ripeness doctrine it is fair to say that its basic rationale is to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties. The problem is best seen in a twofold aspect, requiring us to evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.
In both Abbott Laboratories and its first companion case, Toilet Goods Association v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 158 (1967), the Court upheld pre-enforcement review of an administrative regulation. However, the Court denied such review in the second companion case because any harm from noncompliance with the FDA regulation at issue was too speculative in the Court's opinion to justify judicial review. Justice Harlan wrote for the Court in all three cases.
The ripeness doctrine should not be confused with the advisory opinion doctrine, another justiciability concept in American law."	"Meet Emily, a landscape architect who owns a small design firm. She's been following the development of a new municipal ordinance designed to reduce stormwater runoff in her city. The ordinance requires property owners to install rain gardens on their properties to absorb excess water.

Emily is concerned that the ordinance will increase her design costs and potentially impact her business. She decides to challenge the ordinance in court, seeking a declaration that it's unconstitutional and an injunction to stop its implementation.

However, the ordinance has just been passed and no property owner has been notified that they must install a rain garden. The ordinance hasn't been applied yet, and there's no concrete harm to Emily or her business.

As Emily's lawyer prepares to file a lawsuit, they face a ripeness challenge from the city. The city argues that Emily's claim is not ripe for adjudication because the ordinance hasn't been enforced and any potential harm to Emily's business is speculative.

Emily's lawyer agrees that the court should not preview or second-guess the ordinance at this stage. Instead, they suggest that Emily wait until the city begins enforcing the ordinance and she actually faces a specific problem, such as receiving a notice to install a rain garden or being fined for noncompliance.

In this scenario, the court would likely hold that Emily's claim lacks ripeness and dismiss the case. Emily's lawyer advises her to focus on developing the issue by encouraging the city to enforce the ordinance and then seeking judicial review once the ordinance's effects are felt in a concrete way."
Rule according to higher law	The rule according to a higher law is a philosophical concept that no law may be enforced by the government unless it conforms with certain universal principles (written or unwritten) of fairness, morality, and justice. Thus, the rule according to a higher law may serve as a practical legal criterion to qualify the instances of political or economical decision-making, when a government, even though acting in conformity with clearly defined and properly enacted law, still produces results which many observers find unfair or unjust.	"The small town of Willow Creek was known for its idyllic summer festivals, attracting visitors from all over the country. However, the town council, eager to boost revenue, passed a law requiring all vendors to pay a hefty fee for a permit to sell food at the festivals.

Maria, a young single mother, had been running a popular homemade ice cream cart at the festivals for years, relying on the income to support her family. But with the new law, she wouldn't be able to afford the permit fee, which would put her out of business. She felt that the law unfairly targeted small, family-owned vendors like hers.

Meanwhile, a large corporation, Sweet Delights, Inc., was poised to take over the festival food scene by buying permits for multiple vendors. They didn't need to worry about the permit fee, as they could easily absorb it into their profits.

As the festival season approached, Maria and her fellow small vendors felt forced to close up shop. The townspeople, who had grown attached to Maria's homemade ice cream, were upset and argued that the law was unfair and unjust. Despite being a ""legally"" enacted law, the town council was faced with a moral dilemma: was it right to allow a large corporation to monopolize the festival food scene while small, family-owned businesses like Maria's went under?

The rule according to higher law suggested that no law can be enforced if it goes against universal principles of fairness and justice. In this case, the law would need to be reevaluated, taking into account the impact on small businesses and the community, to ensure that everyone is treated fairly and justly."
Rule against foreign revenue enforcement	"The rule against foreign revenue enforcement, often abbreviated to the revenue rule, is a general legal principle that the courts of one country will not enforce the tax laws of another country.  The rule is part of the conflict of laws rules developed at common law, and forms part of the act of state doctrine.
In State of Colorado v. Harbeck, 133 N.E. 357, 360 (N.Y. 1921) the court referred to

The ... well-settled  principle  of  private international law which precludes one state from acting as a collector of taxes for a sister state and from enforcing its penal or revenue laws as such. The rule is universally recognized that the revenue laws of one state have no force in another.
In England, Lord Denning MR said in Att-Gen of New Zealand v Ortiz [1984] AC 1 at 20: 

No one has ever doubted that our courts will not entertain a suit brought by a foreign sovereign, directly or indirectly, to enforce the penal or revenue laws of that foreign state.  We do not sit to collect taxes for another country or to inflict punishments for it.
The rule has been repeatedly applied in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Singapore, and other countries.  It has also been codified into statute in various countries.

"	"Maria, a Spanish national, had inherited a property in the United States from her uncle. When she decided to sell the property, she found out that she owed back taxes to the Spanish government. To recover the debt, the Spanish tax authority, Hacienda, demanded that Maria transfer the funds from her US bank account directly to their account.

Maria, feeling bullied, consulted with her US-based financial advisor, who advised her to ignore the demand. He explained that the Rule against Foreign Revenue Enforcement would prevent the US courts from enforcing the Spanish tax laws on US soil.

After some contemplation, Maria decided to follow her advisor's advice. When Hacienda sent her a notice threatening to freeze her US bank account, Maria's advisor contested the notice, citing the revenue rule. The case eventually made its way to court, where the judge ruled in Maria's favor, stating that the US courts would not enforce the Spanish tax laws in this situation.

The court's decision allowed Maria to keep her US bank account intact and avoid any direct involvement with the Spanish tax authority. Maria was relieved and grateful that the Rule against Foreign Revenue Enforcement protected her from the encroachment of foreign taxation.

In the end, Maria's decision to seek legal advice and cite the revenue rule saved her from a potential financial nightmare. The story illustrates the legal principle that the courts of one country will not enforce the tax laws of another country, protecting individuals like Maria from unnecessary interference and ensuring the integrity of domestic tax systems."
Rylands v Fletcher	"Rylands v Fletcher (1868) LR 3 HL 330 is a leading decision by the House of Lords which established a new area of English tort law.  It established the rule that one's non-natural use of their land, which leads to another's land being damaged as a result of dangerous things emanating from the land, is strictly liable.
Rylands employed contractors to build a reservoir on his land. As a result of negligent work done, the reservoir burst and flooded a neighbouring mine, run by Fletcher, causing £937 worth of damage (equivalent to £111,200 in 2023). Fletcher brought a claim under negligence against Rylands. At the court of first instance, the majority ruled in favour of Rylands. Baron Bramwell, dissenting, argued that the claimant had the right to enjoy his land free of interference from water, and that Rylands was guilty of trespass and the commissioning of a nuisance. Bramwell's argument was affirmed by the Court of Exchequer Chamber and the House of Lords, leading to the development of the ""Rule in Rylands v Fletcher"". 
This doctrine was further developed by English courts, and made an immediate impact on the law. Prior to Rylands, English courts had not based their decisions in similar cases on strict liability, and had focused on the intention behind the actions rather than the nature of the actions themselves. In contrast, Rylands imposed strict liability on those found detrimental in such a fashion without having to prove a duty of care or negligence, which brought the law into line with that relating to public reservoirs and marked a significant doctrinal shift.  The rule in Rylands has both been distinguished with and regarded as a species of the tort of private nuisance and even construed as a ""liability rule"". Unlike ordinary cases of private nuisance, the rule in Rylands requires the escape of a thing that arises from a non-natural use rather than the typical interference emanating from unreasonable use of land. It additionally does not require an act to be continuous, which is typically a requirement for nuisance. Academics have criticised the rule both for the economic damage such a doctrine could cause and for its limited applicability. 
The tort of Rylands v Fletcher has been disclaimed in various jurisdictions, including Scotland, where it was described as ""a heresy that ought to be extirpated"", and Australia, where the High Court chose to destroy the doctrine in Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty Ltd. Within England and Wales, however, Rylands remains valid law, although the decisions in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc and Transco plc v Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council make it clear that it is no longer an independent tort, but instead a sub-tort of nuisance."	"""The Great River Run-In""

It was a sunny Saturday afternoon when Emma decided to organize a family picnic by the riverbank. Her neighbors, the Smiths, had been using their land to cultivate a beautiful orchard for years, but recently, they had started to build a large dam to create a private reservoir to supply water to their farm.

As the picnic was in full swing, Emma noticed the dam started to leak, causing water to overflow and flood the riverbank. The rushing water swept away the picnic blankets, food, and drinks, and even knocked over the family's small boat, rendering it unrepairable.

The Smiths claimed they had taken all necessary precautions and had warned the authorities about the dam's construction. However, Emma was not convinced and decided to seek compensation for the damage caused to her family's property and belongings.

In court, Emma's lawyers argued that the Smiths' non-natural use of their land (building the dam) had led to a danger that escaped and damaged her property. The judge agreed, ruling that the Smiths were strictly liable for the damages, citing the Rule in Rylands v Fletcher. This meant that the Smiths were accountable for the damage because of their non-natural use of their land, without needing to prove they had acted negligently or with intent to harm.

The Smiths were ordered to pay Emma a significant amount of compensation for the damage caused. While they had built the dam to benefit their farm, they had also put others at risk. This example illustrates the strict liability principle in Rylands v Fletcher, where the non-natural use of land can lead to severe consequences, and the landowner is accountable for the damages that result."
Safe harbor (law)	"A safe harbor is a provision of a statute or a regulation that specifies that certain conduct will be deemed not to violate a given rule.  It is usually found in connection with a more-vague, overall standard.  By contrast, ""unsafe harbors"" describe conduct that will be deemed to violate the rule.
For example, in the context of a statute that requires drivers to ""not drive recklessly"", a clause specifying that ""driving under 25 miles per hour will be conclusively deemed not to constitute reckless driving"" is a ""safe harbor"".  Likewise, a clause saying that ""driving over 90 miles per hour will be conclusively deemed to constitute reckless driving"" would be an ""unsafe harbor"".  In this example, driving between 25 miles per hour and 90 miles per hour would fall outside of either a safe harbor or an unsafe harbor, and would thus be left to be judged according to the vague ""reckless"" standard."	"Emily was a young professional who liked to walk her dog, Max, after work. One evening, while on her daily stroll, Emily spotted a massive storm cloud gathering above. She had just received a notification from her employer that there was no designated parking available at the office the next day, so she decided to take a slightly more direct route home that avoided the main roads.

As she walked, the rain started pouring down, and she quickened her pace. Her phone rang; it was her boss, reminding her about the morning's urgent meeting and asking her to be on time. Emily was already soaking wet, but she picked up the pace even more to get a head start on the traffic.

In her hurry, Emily's support boot slipped on a loose paving stone, causing her to miss a step and lose her balance. Thankfully, a nearby bystander caught her and prevented her from falling into the storm drain. Shaken, Emily took a few moments to collect herself before continuing home.

Later that evening, as Emily reflected on her afternoon, she wondered whether she had been reckless. Technically, the regulations required drivers to be ""prudent when walking on uneven terrain in a rainstorm."" But Emily didn't recall reading anything in the regulations about what speed was speediest – be too slow, or too fast."
Scènes à faire	"A scène à faire (French for ""scene to be made"" or ""scene that must be done""; plural:  scènes à faire; both pronounced [sɛn a fɛʁ]) is a scene in a work of fiction which is almost obligatory for a work in that genre.
In the United States, it also refers to a principle in copyright law in which certain elements of a creative work are held to be not protected when they are mandated by or customary to the genre, a principle which has been expanded to cover other fields such as software development."	"As a struggling author, Sarah had always dreamed of writing the next great mystery novel. She poured her heart and soul into her manuscript, crafting intricate plots and witty dialogue. But as she shopped her work around to publishers, she began to notice a trend. Editors would compliment her writing, but ultimately reject her work, saying ""this is a great take on the genre, but we've seen this before.""

Sarah didn't understand. Her story was original, wasn't it? Yet, as she delved deeper into the mystery genre, she began to realize that certain tropes and conventions were simply expected. The hard-boiled detective, the femme fatale, the sinister plot twist – these were all staples of the genre. And as much as Sarah wove them into her story, they were also the reason her work was being rejected.

It dawned on her that she was unknowingly bound by the principle of ""scenes à faire"". She was creating the very scenes that readers expected to see in a mystery novel, but in doing so, she was also leaving her work open to criticism that it was unoriginal. In the end, Sarah decided to take a risk and mix things up. She created a unique protagonist, one who defied genres and conventions. And while her work was still rejected, this time, it was because it was too different, too bold, and not zany enough.

This experience taught Sarah that in order to stand out, she had to be willing to defy the crowd, to take risks, and to push the boundaries of what was expected. And in doing so, she discovered that the true scene à faire was the one where she took her writing to bold new places, where she pioneered a new wave of storytelling, and where she refused to be bound by the limitations of genre. The rest, as they say, is history."
Scrivener's error	"A clerical error is an error on the part of an office worker, often a secretary or personal assistant. The phrase may also be used as an excuse to deflect blame away from specific individuals, such as high-powered executives, and instead redirect it to the more anonymous clerical staff.
A clerical error in a legal document is called a scrivener's error."	"Here's a story that illustrates the legal concept of a Scrivener's error:

Meet Emily, a busy paralegal working for a law firm. She is tasked with drafting a contract between two companies, ABC Inc. and XYZ Corp. Emily is meticulous and double-checks her work, but in her haste to meet the deadline, she accidentally types the wrong contact information for one of the parties on the second page of the contract.

The contract is signed and executed, but several months later, ABC Inc. claims that XYZ Corp. failed to meet a critical deadline because they never received the notice, which was incorrectly addressed. XYZ Corp. responds that the notice was never delivered, as the contact information was incorrect.

Emily is asked to review the contract to determine what went wrong. Upon reviewing the document, she realizes that she made the error, typing the wrong phone number and email address on page 2. Despite her best efforts, the mistake slipped through the cracks.

This scenario illustrates a Scrivener's error, a clerical mistake made by a professional who is responsible for drafting and preparing legal documents, allowing the courts to potentially unwind the consequences of the error if it can be proven that the mistake was unintended and not malicious. In this case, the courts may decide that the contract is voidable due to the Scrivener's error, which could affect the rights and obligations of all parties involved."
Slippery slope	"In a slippery slope argument, a course of action is rejected because the slippery slope advocate believes it will lead to a chain reaction resulting in an undesirable end or ends. The core of the slippery slope argument is that a specific decision under debate is likely to result in unintended consequences. The strength of such an argument depends on whether the small step really is likely to lead to the effect. This is quantified in terms of what is known as the warrant (in this case, a demonstration of the process that leads to the significant effect).
This type of argument is sometimes used as a form of fearmongering in which the probable consequences of a given action are exaggerated in an attempt to scare the audience. When the initial step is not demonstrably likely to result in the claimed effects, this is called the slippery slope fallacy. This is a type of informal fallacy, and is a subset of continuum fallacy, in that it ignores the possibility of middle ground and assumes a discrete transition from category A to category B. Other idioms for the slippery slope fallacy are the thin edge of the wedge, domino fallacy (as a form of domino effect argument) or dam burst, and various other terms that are sometimes considered distinct argument types or reasoning flaws, such as the camel's nose in the tent, parade of horribles, boiling frog, and snowball effect.

"	"The small town of Oakdale was facing a dilemma. The local government was considering a proposal to allow one small marijuana dispensary to operate within the town limits. The proponents argued that it would bring in much-needed tax revenue and create jobs, while the opponents claimed it would lead to widespread drug use and crime.

Sarah, a concerned citizen, was worried about the implications of allowing marijuana sales. She believed that once the town allowed one dispensary, it would be a slippery slope, leading to more and more dispensaries opening up throughout the town. She argued that before long, Oakdale would become a hub for drug trafficking and the town's reputation would be tarnished.

At first, the town council was skeptical of Sarah's concerns, but she presented a persuasive argument. She pointed out that other cities that had initially allowed small amounts of marijuana had eventually found themselves overwhelmed by the demand and the proliferation of illegal activity. She warned that if Oakdale didn't draw the line at just one dispensary, it would be like ""adding water to a sinking ship."" The more dispensaries that opened, the more it would become a magnet for drug traffickers and users.

The town council took Sarah's concerns seriously and ultimately decided to reject the proposal, citing the potential for a slippery slope. Although some residents were upset by the decision, most agreed that better to err on the side of caution and protect the town's integrity.

In this scenario, Sarah's argument about the slippery slope demonstrates how a single action can lead to a chain reaction of unforeseen consequences. While it's impossible to predict the exact outcome, her warning about the potential harm was enough to sway the town council's decision."
Murders of Haile Kifer and Nicholas Brady	"The murders of Haile Kifer and Nicholas Brady occurred on Thanksgiving Day of 2012, when Haile Kifer, 18, and her cousin, Nicholas Brady, 17, broke into the home of 64-year-old Byron David Smith in Little Falls, Minnesota, in the United States. Smith shot the teens separately and 10 minutes apart as they entered the basement where he was, later stating to police he was worried about them being armed. After already shooting them once, he repeatedly taunted them while they were injured as he shot them both in an execution style until they were dead. He did not report that he had killed Kifer and Brady until the day after the murders, keeping their corpses in his closet. On April 29, 2014, he was found guilty of two counts of premeditated first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
The case sparked debate over the ""castle doctrine"", which allows homeowners to defend their homes with lethal force. The prosecution alleged that Smith's actions and a recording he made himself while the incidents were unfolding showed premeditation (lying in wait) and that he used excessive force after having neutralized the threat. He was convicted by a jury after three hours of deliberation and sentenced to life in prison."	"As the sun set on their quiet suburban neighborhood, the Smiths were preparing for their annual Thanksgiving dinner. Meanwhile, 19-year-old Alex and his friend, 17-year-old Jake, hatched a plan to break into the Smith's house in search of valuables.

Under the cover of darkness, Alex and Jake crept onto the property, trying not to make a sound. They spotted a window that was slightly ajar and decided to make their entry. Unbeknownst to them, Mr. Smith, who was sitting in the basement, had been alerted to their presence by a noise-making device.

As they made their way down to the basement, Alex stopped to adjust his backpack, unaware that Mr. Smith was waiting in the darkness. Suddenly, a shot rang out, and Alex fell to the ground. Terrified, Jake froze, holding his breath as Mr. Smith approached him, gun still in hand.

""I should have killed you when you were on the floor,"" Mr. Smith growled, pressing the gun to Jake's temple. ""You're lucky I chose to spare your life... for now."" Jake collapsed onto the floor, and Mr. Smith left him there, only to return and finish him off with a hollow-point bullet to the head.

This tragic event highlights the legal concept of premeditated murder. As the prosecution argued, Mr. Smith did not act in genuine self-defense, but instead, searched for, and used excessive force against the intruders."
Spider in the web doctrine	"The spider in the web doctrine is a legal doctrine in Dutch patent law governing cross-border injunctions in patent infringement cases.  Under this doctrine, the Dutch courts would assume jurisdiction only in cases where the main defendant (the ""spider"") was located in the Netherlands and where the other defendants were part of a group of companies and acted based on a common business policy of this group (the ""web""), regardless of the nation in which the disputed patent was issued.
Decisions by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) have cast some doubt on the continuing validity of this doctrine.  This is due in part to the fact that the ECJ did not feel that Dutch courts were competent to make predictions or judgments about the validity of patents granted outside the Netherlands, preferring to grant jurisdiction to the countries in which the patent was granted."	"Meet Emma, a brilliant entrepreneur who invented a revolutionary new smartwatch in her garage in Amsterdam. She patented her design and founded ""TechCorp"", a company that would manufacture and distribute her product worldwide. TechCorp has subsidiaries in many countries, including Germany, the UK, and the US.

As TechCorp's product gains popularity, Emma notices that a competitor, ""SmartWatches Inc."" based in California, is copying her design and selling similar smartwatches worldwide. Emma decides to take legal action against SmartWatches Inc. and its subsidiaries in Europe.

In the Netherlands, the Dutch court is asked to issue an injunction against SmartWatches Inc. and its European subsidiaries, claiming they are part of a common ""web"" controlled by the California-based company. The Dutch court applies the ""Spider in the Web"" doctrine and assumes jurisdiction, reasoning that since TechCorp's main defendant (the ""spider"") is located in the Netherlands, and the European subsidiaries are part of the same web, they should also be subject to the Dutch court's jurisdiction.

However, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) later casts doubt on this doctrine, stating that Dutch courts should not assume jurisdiction over patents granted outside the Netherlands. The ECJ prefers to grant jurisdiction to the countries where the patent was granted, in this case, the US.

As a result, the case is re-filed in the US, and SmartWatches Inc. is brought to justice for infringing on Emma's patent. Emma ultimately wins her case, but the expansion of the lawsuit is delayed and more complicated due to the conflicting jurisdictional decisions."
Spring and Autumn Courts	"Spring and Autumn Courts (春秋决狱) were an ancient Chinese judicial system, in which judges judge how to convict a case based on the ideas of righteousness of the Spring and Autumn Annals. The Spring and Autumn Courts began in the reign of Emperor Wu of Han and continued until the Tang dynasty when Confucianism and Jurisprudence merged to create the ""unity of ritual and law"".

"	"During the Han dynasty, a dispute arose between two neighboring villages, Wetang and Shangfang. The villagers of Wetang accused the villagers of Shangfang of stealing their precious rice harvest. The parties involved brought their case to the Imperial Court, seeking justice.

The judges assigned to the case, known as the Spring and Autumn Courts, gathered the evidence and witnesses. They pored over the ancient texts of the Spring and Autumn Annals, seeking guidance on how to render a just verdict.

As they deliberated, one judge, Master Zhou, suggested that the stealing of rice was a violation of the principles of righteousness. ""Is it not wrong for one village to take from another what is not theirs?"" he asked. Another judge, Master Li, countered that perhaps the stealing was not as clear-cut as it seemed. ""Were the villagers of Shangfang perhaps forced to take the rice due to famine or drought?"" he posited.

After careful consideration, the judges decided that the villagers of Shangfang had indeed acted unjustly, but that they had done so out of desperation rather than malice. They ruled that the villagers of Wetang should forgive the offense and that the village of Shangfang should work to replenish their own stores.

The judges' verdict was guided by the principles of the Spring and Autumn Annals, which emphasized the importance of compassion, fairness, and social harmony. The case was settled, and the villagers of both Wetang and Shangfang reconciled, grateful for the wise and compassionate judiciary."
Staatenverbund	Staatenverbund  is a neologism for a system of multi-level governance in which states work more closely together than in a confederation but, unlike a federal state, retain their own sovereignty. The concept is used in Germany to describe the European Union but has no direct equivalent in other languages. In German jurisprudence, a Staatenverbund is a supranational institution that may exercise sovereign acts (laws, coin money, etc.) but may not independently fix areas where it may exercise this power.	"In the charming town of Heidelberg, the annual Wine Festival had become a beloved tradition. As the town's population continued to grow, the local authorities realized that, with the influx of new residents, came new challenges. Housing, infrastructure, and environmental concerns arose, which the town council struggled to tackle on its own.

One day, a delegation from neighboring towns, like Stuttgart and Frankfurt, approached Heidelberg's mayor. They proposed a collaboration to address these common issues, as they too faced similar difficulties. They suggested creating a shared entity, which they dubbed the ""Rhein-Neckar Regional Assembly"" (RNA).

The RNA would have the power to make collective decisions on matters affecting all participating towns, like transportation planning and waste management. However, each town would retain its sovereignty and could veto decisions that didn't align with its interests. The RNA would not have the authority to override individual town laws or finances.

The Heidelberg town council welcomed the idea, and the RNA was born. The mayor of Heidelberg, accompanied by his counterparts from Stuttgart and Frankfurt, signed a declaration outlining the RNA's powers and limitations. The RNA would allow the towns to work together more effectively, yet each would maintain control over its internal affairs.

As the Wine Festival approached, the towns showcased their collaborative achievements, from regional public transportation to joint environmental initiatives. The success of the RNA exemplified the concept of Staatenverbund: a supranational institution exercising limited sovereignty, yet enabling the participating towns to tackle common challenges while preserving their individual autonomy."
Stadtluft macht frei	"Stadtluft macht frei (""urban air makes you free""), or Stadtluft macht frei nach Jahr und Tag (""city air makes you free after a year and a day""), is a German saying describing a principle of law in the Middle Ages. The period of a year and a day was a conventional period widely employed in Europe to represent a significant amount of time.  
From the 11th century onwards, liberated serfs and other members of the Third Estate founded settlements alongside the old Roman or Germanic ones. It was customary law that a city resident was free after one year and one day. After this he could no longer be reclaimed by his employer and thus became bound to the city. Serfs could flee the feudal lands and gain freedom in this way, making cities a territory outside the feudal system to a certain extent. This created the conditions for revolts such as the Münster Rebellion.
With the Statutum in favorem principum (""Statute in Favor of the Princes""), this regulation of customary law was officially abolished for the Holy Roman Empire in 1231/32. According to the statute, cities under royal jurisdiction were forbidden to protect serfs originally owned by the regional princes or their vassals. The statute is an example of power devolving from Imperial authority to that of territorial magnates during the drawn-out contest between the Hohenstaufen emperors and the Papacy.
The medieval concept of liberty was largely confined to traditional collective rights and privileges based in custom and precedent and often expressed in territorial liberties such as, to take English examples, the Liberties of the Tower of London or the Liberties of the Savoy. Historically, the development of individualism is a product of the ideology of liberalism, whose emphasis on modern individual liberties and freedom emerged in opposition to authoritarian oppression, in England culminating in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and in France surfacing during the French Revolution."	"In the small village of Ravenswood, farmland worker Hans spent his days toiling under the control of the local lord, Sir Edward. Hans was bound to the land through a centuries-old feudal contract, leaving him little freedom to make his own choices. One day, Hans had had enough. He packed a small bag and set off towards the nearby city of Ashwood, hoping to escape his life of servitude.

After weeks of traveling, Hans finally arrived in Ashwood, exhausted but determined. He settled into a small cottage near the city gates, where he found work as a blacksmith's apprentice. As months passed, Hans grew to love his new life in the city. He made friends with fellow craftsmen, learned new skills, and even started his own business.

Exactly one year and one day after his arrival, Hans celebrated his newfound freedom. No longer could Sir Edward reclaim him as his serf, and Hans was now free to live his life as he chose. He was not bound to the land or a lord, but to the city and its people.

As Hans raised a cup of ale to his new freedom, he smiled, knowing that the ""city air"" had indeed set him free. He was no longer just a serf, but a citizen of Ashwood, with all the rights and privileges that came with it. And though Sir Edward may have lost his control over Hans, the city had welcomed him with open arms, granting him a chance to build a life of his own."
Stand-your-ground law	"A stand-your-ground law, sometimes called a ""line in the sand"" or ""no duty to retreat"" law, provides that people may use deadly force when they reasonably believe it to be necessary to defend against certain violent crimes (right of self-defense). Under such a law, people have no duty to retreat before using deadly force in self-defense, so long as they are in a place where they are lawfully present. The exact details vary by jurisdiction.
The alternative to stand your ground is ""duty to retreat"". In jurisdictions that implement a duty to retreat, even a person who is unlawfully attacked (or who is defending someone who is unlawfully attacked) may not use deadly force if it is possible to instead avoid the danger with complete safety by retreating.
Even areas that impose a duty to retreat generally follow the ""castle doctrine"", under which people have no duty to retreat when they are attacked in their homes, or (in some places) in their vehicles or workplaces. The castle doctrine and ""stand-your-ground"" laws provide legal defenses to persons who have been charged with various use-of-force crimes against persons, such as murder, manslaughter, aggravated assault, and illegal discharge or brandishing of weapons, as well as attempts to commit such crimes.
Whether a jurisdiction follows stand-your-ground or duty-to-retreat is just one element of its self-defense laws.  Different jurisdictions allow deadly force against different crimes. All American states allow it against prior deadly force, great bodily injury, and likely kidnapping or rape; some also allow it against threat of robbery and burglary.
A 2020 RAND Corporation review of existing research concluded: ""There is supportive evidence that stand-your-ground laws are associated with increases in firearm homicides and moderate evidence that they increase the total number of homicides."""	"It was a hot summer evening when John, a 35-year-old software engineer, was walking home from the grocery store through a dark alley. As he approached his apartment, he noticed a group of teenagers, who looked suspicious, lingering around his building's entrance. One of them, seemingly high on something, approached John, asking him for money. When John refused, the teenager's demeanor turned aggressive.

The group began to close in on John, and one of them grabbed his phone. John felt threatened and realized he needed to defend himself. In Florida, where he lived, law enforcement had emphasized the importance of stand-your-ground laws, which meant John didn't have to retreat before using deadly force.

As the teenagers continued to close in, John's training kicked in, and he drew his concealed pistol. The teenagers, seeing the gun, backed off, but the initial aggressor, now enraged, charged at John. In a split second, John fired, striking the teenager, who fell to the ground. The others fled.

Police arrived, and John, shaken, explained the circumstances. Under Florida's stand-your-ground law, John had exercised his right to self-defense, and the state attorney would likely not pursue charges against him. While some might argue that John could have attempted to flee or called for help, the stand-your-ground law ensured that, provided John was in a lawful place, he did not have to abandon his right to defend himself.

This incident highlights the key principle of stand-your-ground law: when faced with an imminent threat, a person can use deadly force to protect themselves, without the duty to retreat or attempt to escape the danger."
Standard of care	"In tort law, the standard of care is the only degree of prudence and caution required of an individual who is under a duty of care.
The requirements of the standard are closely dependent on circumstances. Whether the standard of care has been breached is determined by the trier of fact, and is usually phrased in terms of the reasonable person; this is sometimes labeled as the ""reasonable physician standard"". It was famously described in Vaughn v. Menlove (1837) as whether the individual ""proceed[ed] with such reasonable caution as a prudent man would have exercised under such circumstances"".

"	"Dr. Smith, a respected gynecologist, had been caring for a patient named Sarah for several months. Sarah was a high-risk pregnancy, and Dr. Smith had advised her to attend regular check-ups and screenings to monitor the baby's health. However, during one of their appointments, Dr. Smith was running late due to a unexpected emergency in the emergency room. As a result, Sarah's appointment was delayed by 30 minutes.

The delay caused Sarah to arrive late for her next scheduled appointment, which was intended to detect a critical congenital anomaly in the baby. However, the test was only offered during a narrow window of time, and by the time Sarah arrived, it was too late. The anomaly was not detected, and the baby was born with a severe condition that required immediate surgery.

In her lawsuit against Dr. Smith, Sarah argued that the doctor had breach the standard of care by failing to schedule a backup appointment or communicate with her in a timely manner. The court had to determine whether Dr. Smith had acted with the same degree of prudence and caution as a reasonable physician in similar circumstances.

In this case, the court found that Dr. Smith had breached the standard of care by being late and not taking necessary precautions to accommodate Sarah's busy schedule. A reasonable physician would have planned for unexpected situations and ensured that Sarah received timely care. Ultimately, the court held Dr. Smith liable for the damages caused by his breach of the standard of care."
Standing (law)	"In law, standing or locus standi is a condition that a party seeking a legal remedy must show they have, by demonstrating to the court, sufficient connection to and harm from the law or action challenged to support that party's participation in the case. A party has standing in the following situations:

The party is directly subject to an adverse effect by the statute or action in question, and the harm suffered will continue unless the court grants relief in the form of damages or a finding that the law either does not apply to the party or that the law is void or can be nullified. In informal terms, a party must have something to lose. The party has standing because they will be directly harmed by the conditions for which they are asking the court for relief.
The party is not directly harmed by the conditions for which they are petitioning the court for relief but asks for it because the harm involved has some reasonable relation to their situation, and the continued existence of the harm may affect others who might not be able to ask a court for relief. In the United States, this is grounds for asking for a law to be struck down for violating the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, because, even though the plaintiff might not be directly affected, the law might adversely affect others, because they might not know when they were violating it. This is known as the ""chilling effects"" doctrine.
The party is granted automatic standing by act of law. For example, under some environmental laws in the United States, a party may sue someone causing pollution to certain waterways without a federal permit, even if the party suing is not harmed by the pollution being generated. The law allows the plaintiff to receive attorney's fees from the defendant if they substantially prevail in the action. In some U.S. states, a person who believes a book, film, or other work of art is obscene may sue in their own name to have the work banned directly without having to ask a district attorney to do so.
In the United States, a person may not bring a suit challenging the constitutionality of a law unless they can demonstrate that they are or will ""imminently"" be harmed by the law. Otherwise, the court will rule that the plaintiff lacks standing to bring the suit and will dismiss it without considering the merits of the claim of unconstitutionality."	"As a local business owner, Emily had always been passionate about keeping her community clean and green. She took pride in maintaining a spotless storefront and hosting community events on her property. Recently, her landlord, Mr. Johnson, had decided to neighboring land for a massive condo development. Emily was devastated by the news, knowing that the project would bring traffic, noise, and pollution to the area.

Emily wanted to take legal action against the project, but she was concerned about standing. She didn't own the neighboring land, and she wasn't directly affected by the project, but she was definitely going to be affected indirectly. The increased noise and pollution would disrupt her business, and the changed traffic patterns would make it harder for her customers to get to her store.

Emily's lawyer advised her that she did have standing to sue, as the harm caused by the project had a reasonable relation to her situation. She wasn't just looking out for herself, but for the overall well-being of her community. The lawyer added that Emily's concerns about the environment and public health were legitimate and gave her the right to ask the court to stop the project.

Feeling empowered, Emily decided to take her case to court. She argued that the project violated environmental regulations and neglected the community's need for green spaces. In the end, the court agreed, and the project was halted. Emily's determination and willingness to take a stand (pardon the pun) paved the way for a cleaner, healthier environment for her community."
State actor	In United States constitutional law, state action is an action by a person who is acting on behalf of a governmental body, and is therefore subject to limitations imposed on government by the United States Constitution, including the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments, which prohibit the federal and state governments from violating certain rights and freedoms.	"Here's a short story:

Mayra was a 20-year-old college student living in a small town with a predominantly Spanish-speaking community. She was an avid participant in student government on campus and had always been passionate about advocating for students' rights and interests.

As a college town, the town council, responsible for making decisions that impacted local students, operated under a provision that allowed them to enforce town ordinances with the help of police officers from the local law enforcement agency. One of these ordinances banned public speaking on campus without a permit, supposedly to maintain order.

During an anti-budget-cut protest, Mayra, frustrated with a proposed tuition hike, decided to use a megaphone to express her thoughts without a permit. Local police officers showed up and arrested Mayra for violating the ordinance. Unbeknownst to Mayra, the police officers were wearing civilian clothes and badges that looked very similar to those of regular officers. Mayra was booked and charged with disorderly conduct.

Responding to the humiliation and consternation, Mayra asked to see her arrest records. Discovering the officer's real intent - to enforce a town ordinance under apparent color of authority, Mayra brought suit, arguing the enforcement of the ban on public speech to be an unconstitutional infringement of her First Amendment rights as protected by the U.S. Constitution.

This scenario illustrates the concept of a state actor: the police officer wears the badge of the local law enforcement agency, seemingly acting with the same powers they would have if the order had come directly from the local government. However, because they leverage the apparent authority of this employment, they become accountable to the constitutional limitations that are set for the government."
Step transaction doctrine	The step transaction doctrine is a judicial doctrine in the United States that combines a series of formally separate steps, resulting in tax treatment as a single integrated event. The doctrine is often used in combination with other doctrines, such as substance over form. The doctrine is applied to prevent tax abuse, such as tax shelters or bailing assets out of a corporation. The step transaction doctrine originated from a common law principle in Gregory v. Helvering, 293 U.S. 465 (1935), which allowed the court to recharacterize a tax-motivated transaction.	"Here's a story that illustrates the step transaction doctrine:

Meet Emma, a successful entrepreneur who owns a small bakery. She's been using the company to fund her passion for making artisanal bread. Emma has been thinking of scaling up her business and is considering buying a larger building to expand her operations.

Emma approaches her lawyer, David, seeking advice on how to acquire the new property. David suggests that Emma buy the building directly, but warns her that the tax implications might not be ideal. Instead, David proposes a creative solution: Emma will form a new corporation, ""Breadwinner Inc.,"" and transfer her ownership stake in the bakery to it. Then, Breadwinner Inc. will borrow money from a bank to purchase the new building.

Emma is delighted by the idea, as she'll only pay taxes on the interest she owes on the loan, rather than the full value of the building. David advises Emma to ensure that the loan is treated as a legitimate debt, so she sets up a promissory note and has the bank record a lien on the property.

However, the IRS audits Emma's taxes and determines that the entire transaction was designed solely to avoid taxes. They argue that the series of steps – forming the new corporation, transferring the bakery, and borrowing money – were merely a disguised attempt to avoid paying taxes. The court agrees, and the step transaction doctrine is applied, treating the entire transaction as a single, integrated event. This means Emma is required to pay taxes on the full value of the building, rather than just the loan interest."
Stopping the clock	"Stopping the clock is a controversial practice in American and Canadian parliamentary procedure in which a legislature literally or notionally stops the clock (or moves the hands backwards), usually for the purpose of meeting a constitutional or statutory deadline. Riddick's Rules of Procedure notes, ""The official clock is stopped by agreement of the 'powers that be' without any motion or announcement one minute before the designated hour."" Sometimes it is done to allow more time for lobbying or deal-making to obtain the necessary votes for one side to prevail on a measure. Some legislatures actually stop the clock, and others simply use it as a metaphor for continuing business after a time deadline has passed. Stopping the clock is also sometimes done for ceremonial purposes to ensure that both houses of a bicameral legislature adjourn simultaneously.
The glossary of the Alabama State Legislature notes that the plug to the electric clock in the Senate or House chamber is sometimes pulled to allow the staff to complete the massive paper work required before sine die adjournment. 
Sometimes a legislature will even take a recess while the clock is stopped and then resume its work. The New York Legislature used to literally stop the clock at midnight on April 1 in order to pass the budget by the constitutional deadline, but eventually ended the practice and began simply disregarding the requirement. In 2004, it finally moved the deadline back to May 1. 
In a debate of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, it was noted that stopping the clock is done by tradition and with unanimous consent, when the Opposition agrees with the Government that valuable business can be done by extending the hours. In contrast, the speaker of the Illinois Legislature unilaterally stopped the clock at midnight on the last day of its session on June 30, 1988, to allow further debate before approving money to replace Comiskey Park, a decision that ultimately passed by one vote. Had this maneuver not been done, the White Sox presumably would have moved to Florida. Stadium consultant Marc Ganis noted, ""As the clock struck down in St. Petersburg, they started popping champagne corks and didn't realize that the speaker of the house can literally stop the clock in Illinois. At the stroke of midnight, we got to 60 votes."""	"It was June 30th, the last day of the legislative session in Sacramento, California. The House of Representatives was in a heated debate over a bill to build a new highway system. With only 30 minutes left before the constitutional deadline, the speaker of the House, Rachel Lee, stood up and suggested stopping the clock to allow more time for negotiations. After some deliberation, both sides agreed, and the chamber's clock was brought to a standstill.

As the clock froze at 11:30 PM, the room erupted into a flurry of lobbying and horse-trading. The supporters of the bill huddled with the opponents, trying to convince them to switch their votes. Meanwhile, the House staff scrambled to complete the paperwork necessary for the bill's passage.

The clock remained stopped as the representatives worked tirelessly to find a compromise. Finally, after several hours of intense negotiations, a deal was reached. The bill was passed, and the House adjourned without having stopped the clock formally, but it was clear what had happened - the clock had been effectively stopped to allow for the necessary time to secure the votes.

The debate team patted themselves on the back, grateful that the last-minute agreement had been reached and the bill would be put into effect. But in the back room, Rachel whispered to her aide, ""We couldn't have done it without stopping the clock. It was the only way we were going to get the votes."" The world outside remained oblivious to the hush-hush maneuver, but in the legislative world of Sacramento, stopping the clock was a well-understood convention that allowed business to be done."
Subsidiarity	"Subsidiarity is a principle of social organization that holds that social and political issues should be dealt with at the most immediate or local level that is consistent with their resolution. The Oxford English Dictionary defines subsidiarity as ""the principle that a central authority should have a subsidiary function, performing only those tasks which cannot be performed at a more local level"". The concept is applicable in the fields of government, political science, neuropsychology, cybernetics, management and in military command (mission command). The OED adds that the term ""subsidiarity"" in English follows the early German usage of ""Subsidiarität"". More distantly, it is derived from the Latin verb subsidio (to aid or help), and the related noun subsidium (aid or assistance).
The development of the concept of subsidiarity has roots in the natural law philosophy of Thomas Aquinas and was mediated by the social scientific theories of Luigi Taparelli, SJ, in his 1840–43 natural law treatise on the human person in society. In that work, Taparelli established the criteria of just social order, which he referred to as ""hypotactical right"" and which came to be termed subsidiarity following German influences.
Another origin of the concept is in the writings of Calvinist law-philosopher Johannes Althaus who used the word ""subsidia"" in 1603. As a principle of just social order, it became one of the pillars of modern Catholic social teaching. Subsidiarity is a general principle of European Union law. In the United States of America, Article VI, Paragraph 2 of the constitution of the United States is known as the Supremacy Clause. This establishes that the federal constitution, and federal law generally, take precedence over state laws, and even state constitutions. The principle of States' Rights is sometimes interpreted as being established by the Tenth Amendment, which says that ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."""	"Meet Emily, a local business owner in a small town. She owns a popular bakery that employs several people in the community. The town has a vibrant downtown area where many local shops and restaurants are located.

One day, Emily notices that a homeless individual often visits the shops in the area, causing a nuisance and disrupting the businesses. The occasional encounters are stressful, and the owners feel that something needs to be done. Emily decides to take the initiative and proposes to the other local business owners a plan to create a local organization to help the homeless individual.

The plan is to provide basic necessities like food, clothing, and shelter to the individual, and also connect them with local authorities and social services. The goal is to create a sense of community and social responsibility among the local businesses.

The other business owners are impressed with Emily's proposal and decide to support her initiative. They work together to gather resources, volunteer their time, and coordinate efforts. The local government, however, has a separate program in place to address homelessness, but it focuses on long-term solutions and may take time to take effect.

In this scenario, the principle of subsidiarity is applied. The local community, comprising Emily and the other business owners, deals with the issue of homelessness at the most immediate level, providing temporary support and assistance to the individual. The local government's program for homelessness takes a more comprehensive approach, dealing with the issue at a higher level and providing long-term solutions. This approach acknowledges that smaller, local efforts can have a significant impact, while also recognizing that larger, more systemic issues may require a broader, more comprehensive response."
Substance over form	"Substance over form is an accounting principle used ""to ensure that financial statements give a complete, relevant, and accurate picture of transactions and events"". If an entity practices the 'substance over form' concept, then the financial statements will convey the overall financial reality of the entity (economic substance), rather than simply reporting the legal record of transactions (form). In accounting for business transactions and other events, the measurement and reporting is for the economic impact of an event, instead of its legal form. Substance over form is critical for reliable financial reporting. It is particularly relevant in cases of revenue recognition, sale and purchase agreements, etc. The key point of the concept is that a transaction should not be recorded in such a manner as to hide the true intent of the transaction, which would mislead the readers of a company's financial statements."	"Sarah, a small business owner, entered into an agreement with her cousin, Alex, to store her inventory in his warehouse for a fee. On the surface, the agreement looked like a typical rental agreement, with a lease term, rent, and security deposit. However, the reality was different. Sarah would only keep the inventory in Alex's warehouse for a short period, usually a few days, and then re-sell it. Alex would then re-rent the same space to other businesses. The agreement was structured this way because Alex's warehouse was strategically located, making it easier for Sarah to sell her products quickly.

One day, an auditor reviewed Sarah's financial statements and noticed that the rental income from Alex's warehouse was recorded as a normal rental income. The auditor questioned why Sarah was recording the income as rental income, when in essence, she was essentially flipping the inventory. The auditor argued that the true substance of the transaction was not the rental income, but rather the sale of the inventory.

After reviewing the facts, Sarah realized that the auditor was correct. She was recording the rental income as a way to disguise the real transaction, which was the sale of inventory. To accurately reflect the financial reality of the transaction, Sarah changed the accounting treatment to record the income as the sale of inventory, rather than rental income. By doing so, she ensured that her financial statements accurately reflected the true intent of the transaction, rather than just its legal form. This is an example of the substance over form principle, where the focus is on the economic reality of the transaction, rather than just its legal representation."
Substantial certainty doctrine	"In law, the substantial certainty doctrine is the assumption of intent even if the actor did not intend the result, but knew with substantial certainty the effect would occur as a result of his action. The doctrine can be used by courts as a test to determine whether or not a defendant committed a tort. For example, in Garratt v. Dailey (1955), the Washington Supreme Court remanded a case back to the lower courts to determine whether or not the five year-old defendant ""knew with substantial certainty that the plaintiff would attempt to sit down where the chair which he moved had been."""	"Sarah, a construction worker, was tasked with moving a heavy crate in a warehouse. She knew that the crate was prone to tipping over and causing harm, but she didn't want to waste time finding a safer way to move it. In a hurry, she quickly pushed the crate without securing it properly, knowing with substantial certainty that someone would likely walk into the path of the falling crate.

To her dismay, a coworker, Alex, was indeed walking in that direction. As the crate fell, Sarah shouted a warning, but it was too late. Alex was hit and suffered serious injuries.

The question now is, did Sarah intend for Alex to get hurt? Not explicitly, but Sarah knew with substantial certainty that her reckless action would likely cause harm to someone. She didn't bother to take precautions or find a safer way to move the crate because she was in a rush.

In this scenario, the court might apply the substantial certainty doctrine, assuming that Sarah intended to cause harm because she knew with substantial certainty that her actions would lead to Alex's injuries. This doctrine would hold Sarah liable for the harm caused, even if she didn't explicitly intend for Alex to get hurt.

This concept is often applied in cases where someone's actions are reckless or negligent, but they didn't explicitly intend to cause harm. The doctrine serves as a crucial test for determining whether a defendant can be held liable for the harm they caused."
Substantial performance	"At common law, substantial performance is an alternative principle to the perfect tender rule. It allows a court to imply a term that allows a partial or substantially similar performance to stand in for the performance specified in the contract.
This principle is relevant when a contractor's performance is in some way deficient, through no willful act by the contractor, yet is so nearly equivalent that it would be unreasonable for the owner to deny the agreed upon payment. If a contractor successfully demonstrates substantial performance, the owner remains obligated to fulfill payment, less any damages suffered as a result of the deficiencies in workmanship by the contractor.
The principle is also found in the law of unilateral contracts. Unilateral contracts are contracts in which one party offers a promise in exchange for an actual performance. Traditionally, such contracts were deemed to be effective once the specified performance was tendered, and could be revoked at any time prior to completion of the performance, presenting the notorious ""Cedric Brooklyn Bridge problem"": in theory, A could say to B ""I'll give you $100 if you walk across the Brooklyn Bridge"", and then, just before B finishes crossing, pull up to him in a car and say ""The deal is off,"" at which point no contract would be formed and A would not be liable to B for anything. This result was deemed unacceptable by many jurists and legal scholars, and applied the doctrine of substantial performance to this situation, effectively deeming someone who had begun the performance to have established an option contract to hold the unilateral contract open. This principle is enunciated in Section 237 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts."	"Mark, a novice home improvement contractor, was hired by Sarah to renovate her kitchen. The contract specified a 30-day deadline and a 10% discount for timely completion. Mark poured his heart and soul into the project, but just a week shy of the deadline, a sudden rainstorm caused a pipe to burst, flooding the kitchen and damaging the newly installed cabinets.

Despite his best efforts, Mark couldn't finish the job on time. The cabinets had to be replaced, and the flooring needed to be completely redone. Mark worked tirelessly to repair the damage and complete the remaining tasks, but ultimately finished three days late.

Sarah was understandably frustrated, but Mark presented her with a reasonable plan to rectify the situation. He offered a detailed timeline and budget for the additional work required to meet the original specifications. Sarah was impressed by Mark's dedication and professionalism, and decided to have the job inspected to determine if Mark had substantially performed according to the contract.

The inspector found that Mark had completed most of the work, just short of the final inspections. Sarah realized that while Mark hadn't met the strict deadline, he had provided nearly identical performance to what was originally agreed upon. She decided to pay Mark the full amount, minus a small deduction for the additional time it took to complete the job. Mark's substantial performance had salvaged the deal, and Sarah remained committed to fulfilling their agreement.

This scenario illustrates the concept of substantial performance, where a contractor's close but not perfect fulfillment of a contract remains sufficient to warrant payment, as long as the contract's terms are not grossly breached. The doctrine allows for a nuanced approach to contract enforcement, balancing the owner's expectations with the contractor's actual performance."
Substantial truth	Substantial truth is a legal doctrine affecting libel and slander laws in common law jurisdictions such as the United States or the United Kingdom.	"MeetEmma, a successful businesswoman who has been in the industry for over a decade. She had a public falling out with her former business partner, Jack, over a disputed contract. The alleged fraud was widely reported in the local business newspaper, and several of Emma's clients began to question her ethics, saying her reputation had been sullied.

One day, a rival businesswoman, Sarah, published an article online stating that Emma had been involved in the very same contract dispute. The article, however, made a few subtle changes to the events. It claimed that Emma had had a ""history of shady dealings"" and that Jack had been the one who noticed her ""reprehensible"" behavior.

In reality, Emma had never been involved in any illicit activities, and the dispute was simply a misunderstanding. Although the article wasn't entirely accurate, it contained a substantial amount of truth. Emma felt her reputation had been harmed, and she sued Sarah for libel.

However, during the trial, it became clear that Sarah had made some exaggerated and unfounded claims, but also truthfully reported the dispute and Jack's negative opinion of Emma. The judge ruled that the article contained substantial truth, as it revealed a genuine dispute between Emma and Jack, even if the rest of the claims were unfounded. Therefore, Sarah wasn't liable for libel, as the majority of the article's content was true.

In this scenario, the substantial truth doctrine shielded Sarah from the libel suit. The doctrine recognizes that a statement can be partially true and partially false, but still have a factual basis, which can be an essential exception to the strict liability for libel and slander."
Sufficient similarity	"Sufficient similarity is a 20th-century para-legal concept used in the chemical industry for toxicological studies. The term was first employed in a restricted sense to assess surrogacy of chemical mixtures by the EPA, and has descended from there into the scientific argot.
The concept is somewhat nebulous, and statistics are involved. A group of America researchers in 2018 posed themselves the question how similar must a product be in order to be well-represented by the tested reference sample? Because the concept was derived from the EPA, chemical similarity and biological similarity are equally important. The concept is employed ""so that safety data from the tested reference can be applied to untested materials,"" because ""when toxicity data are not available for a chemical mixture of concern, US EPA guidelines allow risk assessment to be based on data for a surrogate mixture considered “sufficiently similar” in terms of chemical composition and component proportions."""	"Here's a story to illustrate the concept of ""sufficient similarity"":

Imagine you're a new mom, and your neighbor's family has just moved in next door. You're concerned about the new pesticide they use in their yard to control weeds. You've heard it's effective, but you're worried about the health effects on your own family. Your neighbor assures you that the product is safe and points to tests conducted on a similar product, say, ""GreenShield 5000.""

The EPA has done extensive research on GreenShield 5000, and they've found that it's toxic to certain animals at high concentrations. But your neighbor mentions that the new product they're using is a ""salvage product"" made from a blend of leftover chemicals, and they're assured by the manufacturer that it's been reformulated to be ""sufficiently similar"" to GreenShield 5000.

The manufacturer's argument is that while the actual composition of the new product might not be a perfect match, its chemical properties and component proportions are close enough to the tested GreenShield 5000 to consider it a safe substitute. In other words, they argue that the new product is like a ""stand-in"" for GreenShield 5000, and the safety data collected for GreenShield 5000 can be applied to the new product.

However, you, as a concerned mom, are skeptical. You'd like to see more evidence confirming the new product's safety, especially since its composition is not identical to GreenShield 5000. You worry that the manufacturer is relying too heavily on a rough approximation, rather than a more thorough analysis of the new product's characteristics.

This scenario illustrates the concept of ""sufficient similarity,"" where the safety data from a tested reference product (GreenShield 5000) is being applied to an untested second substance (the new pesticide) deemed ""sufficiently similar"" based on chemical composition and component proportions."
Suspect classification	"In United States constitutional law, a suspect classification is a class or group of persons meeting a series of criteria suggesting they are likely the subject of discrimination. These classes receive closer scrutiny by courts when an Equal Protection claim alleging unconstitutional discrimination is asserted against a law, regulation, or other government action, or sometimes private action. When a law or government action affects a group that falls under a ""suspect classification,"" courts apply the strict scrutiny standard in reviewing the constitutional validity of a law or action."	"Here's a relatable scenario:

Meet Maria, a single mother of two who has struggled to make ends meet since her husband's unexpected passing. Despite working multiple jobs, Maria's family still relies on government assistance to get by. Her children are eligible for free meals at school, and the mortgage on their small apartment is subsidized through a federal program.

Recently, the government introduced a new policy requiring all recipients of assistance to prove they are actively seeking employment to continue receiving benefits. Maria is devastated by the news, knowing that finding a reliable job with flexible hours will be nearly impossible, especially with her children's needs.

As a single mother, Maria believes the new policy targets her and others like her with alarming frequency. She finds it difficult to understand why the government would enforce such a policy when she knows there are many able-bodied individuals receiving assistance without demonstrating efforts to find employment.

Maria decides to fight the policy, citing the Equal Protection clause in the 14th Amendment. Her attorney argues that, as a single mother, she falls under a suspect classification as the law disproportionately affects her and other women who are primary caregivers. The court must apply strict scrutiny in reviewing the policy to ensure it does not violate Maria's constitutional rights.

The story illustrates how suspect classification applies in this scenario. As a single mother, Maria is part of a group that the court recognizes as being particularly vulnerable to discrimination. The government's action, in this case, the policy, must withstand the most intense judicial scrutiny to avoid being declared unconstitutional."
Taint (legal)	"Taint is a term used in the legal field with reference to evidence that has been ""tainted"" or ruined in some manner. The most common of such usage is with reference to evidence, testimony, identification by witnesses, or confessions that have been obtained by law enforcement illegally. The illegality usually results from a violation of one's constitutional rights, such as a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution protecting against unreasonable search and seizure. For example, the dissent in the Supreme Court decision of Missouri v. Seibert stated that ""the court must examine whether the taint dissipated through the passing of time ... ."" Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600, 628 (U.S. 2004) (Justice O'Connor Dissent, emphasis added). The court in Wong Sun v. U.S., discussed ""purg[ing] of the primary taint"" with reference to allowing evidence because the defendant's statements were voluntary and a lengthy period of time had passed as an intervening act. Wong Sun v. U.S., 371 U.S. 471, (1963) (quoting J. Maguire, Evidence of Guilt 221 (1959) (emphasis added) (stating: ""... by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint."")).
Investigators sometimes employ a ""filter team,"" or ""taint team,"" composed of individuals not involved in an investigation, to prevent investigators from seeing information that could taint evidence, such as information protected by attorney-client privilege."	"Here's a short story that illustrates the concept of taint:

Meet Alex, a detective with the local police department. Alex was investigating a burglary at a jewelry store where a valuable necklace was stolen. During the interrogation of the prime suspect, Alex's partner, Officer Johnson, used coercive tactics to obtain a confession from the suspect. Officer Johnson told the suspect that their surveillance footage showed him with a similar necklace, and that he had an eyewitness who identified him. This was a lie, but the suspect, under pressure, confessed to the crime.

As it turns out, Officer Johnson's partner had obtained evidence that was critical of the real perpetrator, but the suspect had not committed the crime. The suspect had been sold the counterfeit necklace by someone else. Alex found out about the real owner and managed to track down the real perpetrator.

The suspect's confession, obtained under duress, becomes tainted evidence because it was the product of coercive and illegal means. Even though Alex discovered the real perpetrator, the suspect's confession would never be admissible in court because it was ruled inadmissible – it had been tainted by the illegality of Officer Johnson's actions.

A judge would likely suppress the tainted confession, making it impossible for the prosecution to use it in court."
Tea Rose – Rectanus doctrine	The Tea Rose-Rectanus doctrine or remote, good-faith user doctrine is a common law rule of United States trademark law that determines the geographic scope of rights.  The doctrine allows a junior user of a mark that is geographically remote from the senior user of the mark to establish priority over a senior user's claim to the mark in the junior user's area.  The constructive use and notice sections of the Lanham Act limited the applicability of this doctrine.	"Here's a story that illustrates the Tea Rose-Rectanus doctrine:

Meet Emma, a young entrepreneur who has always been passionate about baking. She decides to open her own bakery, ""Flour & Fancy,"" and creates a unique logo featuring a stylized tea rose. Unbeknownst to Emma, there's already a bakery with the same name, ""Flour & Fancy,"" owned by Mark in New York City. Mark has been using the mark since 2015 and has built a loyal customer base.

Emma, however, opens her bakery in Portland, Oregon, in 2018, over 2,500 miles away from Mark's bakery in New York. She uses the same name and logo, but with no knowledge of Mark's existing business. As Emma's bakery gains popularity, Mark learns about the new bakery and claims that Emma is infringing on his trademark.

However, a court hearing decides that Emma is protected by the Tea Rose-Rectanus doctrine. Since Emma's bakery is located far from Mark's, she is considered a ""remote, good-faith user."" The doctrine allows her to establish priority over Mark's claim to the ""Flour & Fancy"" mark in the Portland area, where she had no knowledge of Mark's earlier use.

In this scenario, Emma's bakery is able to coexist with Mark's bakery, as the court recognizes that Emma's use of the name and logo is constructive (i.e., actual use, rather than just intent to use) and in good faith, within the Portland market. The story illustrates how the Tea Rose-Rectanus doctrine helps to establish a geographic scope of rights, allowing junior users to operate legally despite senior users' prior claims."
Tender years doctrine	"The tender years doctrine is a legal principle in family law since the late 19th century. In common law, it presumes that during a child's ""tender"" years (generally regarded as the age of four and under), the mother should have custody of the child. The doctrine often arises in divorce proceedings."	"Sarah and Michael had been married for five years when they decided to separate. They had two children, Emily, who was three, and Jack, who was six. As the divorce proceedings began, custody became the main point of contention. Michael claimed he should have joint custody, arguing that he was equally involved in raising the children. Sarah, on the other hand, insisted that she should have sole custody, citing the tender years doctrine.

As the judge reviewed the case, she couldn't help but consider the tender years doctrine. Research suggested that children under the age of four required extensive emotional and physical support, which was best provided by their primary caregiver – typically the mother. The judge noted that Emily, being only three, still relied heavily on Sarah for daily care and comfort.

In the courtroom, the judge observed the children's interactions with each parent. During his brief visitation session, Michael appeared distracted, and Emily clung to Sarah's leg, refusing to let go. Meanwhile, Jack, who was with Michael, seemed more comfortable and engaged. The judge weighed the evidence and decided to grant Sarah sole custody of Emily, citing the tender years doctrine. She believed that Sarah was better equipped to provide the attention and care Emily needed at this stage in her development.

While Michael was disappointed, the judge's decision was in line with the prevailing legal principle. The tender years doctrine prioritized the well-being of young children, assuming that mothers were better suited to provide the necessary nurturing during this critical period."
Terra nullius	"Terra nullius (, plural terrae nullius) is a Latin expression meaning ""nobody's land"".
Since the nineteenth century it has occasionally been used in international law as a principle to justify claims that territory may be acquired by a state's occupation of it. There are currently three territories sometimes claimed to be terra nullius: Bir Tawil (a strip of land between Egypt and the Sudan), four pockets of land near the Danube due to the Croatia–Serbia border dispute, and parts of Antarctica, principally Marie Byrd Land."	"It was a hot summer day when Jack, a young adventurer, stumbled upon a hidden cove on the coast of a remote island. The white sandy beach and crystal-clear waters were breathtakingly beautiful. Jack had always dreamed of owning a piece of land, and this seemingly uninhabited cove seemed like the perfect opportunity.

Excited by his discovery, Jack decided to claim the cove as his own. He planted a flag on the beach, marking the boundaries of his new property. Weeks went by, and Jack started to build his dream home among the palm trees. He even started a small business catering to passing travelers.

However, Jack's peaceful life was disrupted when a group of local fishermen arrived at the cove, claiming it as their traditional fishing grounds. Jack was taken aback and argued that he had already staked his claim to the land. The fishermen, backed by the local authorities, maintained that the cove was never formally claimed or inhabited, making it terra nullius – nobody's land.

As the dispute escalated, Jack realized that his occupation of the cove didn't grant him ownership. The fishermen, and by extension the local government, argued that since the land was never formally claimed, it remained unclaimed and available for use by all. In the end, Jack was forced to dismantle his home and business, and the cove was restored to its original state, awaiting the arrival of a future claimant or the local authorities to take formal control.

This story illustrates the legal concept of terra nullius, where the occupation of a territory by an individual or group does not automatically grant ownership. The principle holds that territory remains unclaimed and available for use by all until a legitimate claimant arises."
Territorial principle	"The territorial principle (also territoriality principle) is a principle of public international law which enables a sovereign state to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over individuals and other legal persons within its territory. It includes both the right to prosecute individuals for criminal offences committed within its borders, as well as the right to arrest and apprehend individuals within its territory. Its corollary bars states from exercising jurisdiction within the territory of other states without their express consent, unless such an exercise can be based on other principles of jurisdiction, such as the principle of nationality, the passive personality principle, the protective principle, and possibly, the principle of universal jurisdiction.
The Lotus case was a key court ruling on the territoriality principle. In 1926, a French vessel collided with a Turkish vessel, causing the death of several Turkish nationals. The Permanent Court of International Justice ruled, by a bare majority, that Turkey had jurisdiction to try the French naval lieutenant for criminal negligence, even though the incident happened beyond Turkey's boundaries. This case extended the territoriality principle to cover cases that happen outside a state's boundaries, but have a substantial effect on the state's interests or involve its citizens.
Questions have surfaced regarding how the territoriality principle applies with the rise of globalization and the Internet. The applicability of this principle was in question with the case against Augusto Pinochet and other cases of transnational justice."	"The Small Town of Willow Creek

Willow Creek was a quaint town nestled in the heart of the United States. Its residents lived simple lives, relying on the local diner, the town's annual fair, and the family-owned grocery store. The town was often visited by travelers from neighboring cities, but rarely did strangers stay overnight.

One fateful evening, a group of rowdy partygoers from a neighboring city crashed a house party in Willow Creek. The group, comprising young adults from a different state, had heard about the party through social media and decided to join in on the fun. As the night wore on, a heated argument ensued, resulting in a physical altercation between two of the partygoers. One of them suffered a severe head injury and was rushed to the hospital.

The town's residents, outraged by the incident, demanded action from the local authorities. The police, however, were faced with a dilemma. The incident had occurred within the town's limits, but the perpetrators were not locals. Should they arrest and prosecute the out-of-state visitors?

The town mayor, a staunch advocate for the territorial principle, believed that the officials had a duty to protect the town's residents and uphold the law, regardless of where the perpetrators came from. After all, the incident had occurred within their territory, and it was their responsibility to keep the community safe.

In the end, the police decided to exercise their jurisdiction and arrest the perpetrators. The town's residents breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that their local authorities would not let the incident go unpunished. This scenario illustrates the territorial principle in action: a sovereign state (in this case, the town of Willow Creek) has the right and duty to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over individuals and crimes committed within its territory, regardless of the perpetrators' nationality or where the incident occurred."
Tipsy Coachman	"The Tipsy Coachman doctrine is a rule of law that upholds in a higher court a correct conclusion, despite flawed reasoning by the judge in a lower court. In other words, the lower judgment was right but for the wrong reason.
The colorful ""tipsy coachman"" label comes from a 19th-century Georgia case, Lee v. Porter, 63 Ga 345, 346 (1879), in which the Georgia Supreme Court, noting that the ""human mind is so constituted that in many instances it finds the truth when wholly unable to find the way that leads to it"", quoted from Oliver Goldsmith's Retaliation: A Poem written in 1774:

The Florida Supreme Court explained the doctrine in a 2002 appeal from a second-degree murder conviction:

We start with the proposition that generally, if a claim is not raised in the [trial] court, it will not be considered on appeal. However, notwithstanding this principle, in some circumstances, even though a trial court's ruling is based on improper reasoning, the ruling will be upheld if there is any theory or principle of law in the record which would support the ruling.

This longstanding principle of appellate law, sometimes referred to as the 'tipsy coachman' doctrine, allows an appellate court to affirm a trial court that reaches the right result but for the wrong reasons so long as there is any basis which would support the judgment in the record."	"Meet Emily, a passionate artist who owned a small studio in a trendy neighborhood. One day, she discovered that her former business partner, Ryan, had been secretly using their shared studio as a storage space for his own business ventures. Emily was furious and sued Ryan for breach of contract, claiming that he had misused the studio and damaged their partnership.

In the trial court, Emily's lawyer presented a convincing argument, highlighting the contractual agreement that specifically prohibited Ryan from using the studio for anything other than their joint business. The judge agreed and ordered Ryan to compensate Emily for the damages caused by his actions.

On appeal, Ryan's lawyer argued that the trial court had no jurisdiction to rule on the matter, citing a technicality in the contract. However, the appeals court discovered a separate clause in the contract that stated the parties had agreed to resolve disputes through arbitration, not litigation. Despite the trial court's flawed reasoning, the appeals court upheld the judgment in favor of Emily, citing the ""tipsy coachman"" doctrine.

In this scenario, the trial court had arrived at the correct conclusion (requiting Ryan to compensate Emily), but based its decision on the wrong legal principle (the contract). The appeals court, however, found a separate, applicable principle in the contract (the arbitration clause) that supported the original judgment. This demonstrates the ""tipsy coachman"" doctrine in action, where the courts can affirm a lower court's decision, even if the reasoning is flawed, as long as there is another valid legal basis in the record."
Tolling (law)	"Tolling is a legal doctrine that allows for the pausing or delaying of the running of the period of time set forth by a statute of limitations, such that a lawsuit may potentially be filed even after the statute of limitations has run. Although grounds for tolling the statute of limitations vary by jurisdiction, common grounds include:

The plaintiff was a minor at the time a cause of action accrued.
The plaintiff has been deemed mentally incompetent.
The plaintiff has been convicted of a felony and is imprisoned.
The defendant has filed a bankruptcy case triggering a stay of other lawsuits.
The defendant is not physically within a certain jurisdiction (for example, a state or country).
The parties were engaged in good-faith negotiations to resolve a dispute without litigation when the statute of limitations expired.
Tolling may occur under a statute that specifically provides for the tolling of the statute of limitations during specified circumstances. It may also take the form of equitable tolling, where the court applies common law principles of equity to extend the time for the filing of a document."	"Sarah was a teenager when her neighbor, James, drove his car into her parked vehicle, causing significant damage. At the time, Sarah didn't know how to deal with the situation and didn't report the incident to the police or James's insurance company. She just shrugged it off, thinking it was a minor issue that would go away on its own.

Years passed, and Sarah grew up. She never forgot about the damage to her car, but she never took any legal action against James either. One day, Sarah decided to take a closer look at the damage and realized that it was more extensive than she had initially thought. She consulted with an attorney and learned that the statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit against James had expired – she had missed the deadline by several years.

However, Sarah's attorney discovered that Sarah had been underage when the incident occurred, which was a ground for tolling the statute of limitations. Although the original deadline had passed, Sarah was still entitled to file a lawsuit against James. The court eventually allowed the suit to proceed, and James was forced to pay Sarah for the damage he had caused.

In this scenario, the statute of limitations was tolled due to Sarah's minority status at the time the cause of action accrued. This allowed her to file a lawsuit against James, even though the statute of limitations had expired in the meantime."
Totality principle	"The totality principle is a common law principle which applies when a court imposes multiple sentences of imprisonment. The principle was first formulated by David Thomas in his 1970 study of the sentencing decisions of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales:

The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences, to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate is 'just and appropriate'. The principle has been stated many times in various forms: 'when a number of offences are being dealt with and specific punishments in respect of them are being totted up to make a total, it is always necessary for the court to take a last look at the total just to see whether it looks wrong'; 'when ... cases of multiplicity of offences come before the court, the court must not content itself by doing the arithmetic and passing the sentence which the arithmetic produces. It must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and ask itself what is the appropriate sentence for all the offences.'"	"Emily was a determined shoplifter who had amassed a list of six conviction offenses in a single year. She had stolen items worth thousands of dollars from various stores, including designer clothing, handbags, and jewelry. The judge had found her guilty of all six charges and decided to sentence her consecutively, which meant that each sentence would run one after the other rather than concurrently.

Initially, the judge considered the six separate counts, adding up a total of two years in prison time: six months for each offense to be served consecutively.

But then, the judge took a step back and reviewed the totality of Emily's behavior. She realized that the six separate shoplifting incidents were all connected to her underlying addiction to designer goods. She had been stealing to feed her obsession, and her actions were driven by a common motivation.

With this insight, the judge re-examined the total sentence. Two years seemed disproportionate in light of her behavior as a whole. The judge considered a more comprehensive view of Emily's actions and decided to reduce the total sentence, ultimately imposing a sentence of 18 months for all six offenses.

In this scenario, the totality principle influenced the judge's decision. The judge looked beyond the separate sentences and considered the aggregate sentence as a whole. Taking a step back, the judge evaluated whether the total sentence reflected the severity of Emily's overall behavior and ultimately decided to adjust it to better reflect her broader circumstances."
Transnational child protection	"Transnational child protection refers to the protection of children from violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect in an international setting. When a non-national child comes into contact with public authorities and service providers, a series of checks, assessments and immediate measures sets in to identify the child and to assess her or his situation. Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child provides for the protection of children in and out of the home, including in their country of origin, residence or a third country. Article 2 of the Convention provides for the right to non-discrimination, meaning children have the right to protection regardless of the national origin or status of the child or his or her parents or legal guardians.
A child may become party to a transnational child protection case because of a need for protection, including: due to international adoption, being born to parents with different or multiple nationalities, being born in a different country than either parent's nationality, and migrating or being trafficked. Being an unaccompanied or separated minor comes with particular challenges."	"**The Case of Sophie**

Sophie, a 10-year-old girl, is born to a French mother and an American father in a hospital in London. Her parents, who had been living in the UK for a few years as students, had planned to raise Sophie in the UK. When Sophie's mother had a medical emergency, she was rushed to the hospital, and Sophie was born prematurely. However, while hospitalized, Sophie's case was referred to the UK authorities due to concerns about her well-being.

The UK social services, Child Protection Team, got involved to assess Sophie's situation. As an international child, part of Sophie's identity and needs were not immediately clear-cut. At first, her nationality was unresolved, and her parents' relationship was strained due to language barriers and differing opinions on raising Sophie.

Through collaboration with international authorities in France and the US, the UK team discovered that Sophie's father's family was struggling financially in the US, and her mother's visa in the UK was about to expire. The case team recognized Sophie's vulnerability as an international child without clear residency status and needed to ensure her rights and support. 

With further investigation, it was determined that Sophie could be protected under Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which guarantees protection for children in and out of the home regardless of their nationality or the status of their parents. The UK Child Protection Team, in coordination with international partners, worked together to secure permanent legal residency for Sophie in the UK and offered necessary support and care for the young girl."
Treaty body	In international law, a treaty body (or treaty-based body) is an internationally established body of independent experts that monitor how States party to a particular international legal instrument are implementing their obligations under it.	"As the newly elected representative of a small country in Central America, Sofia had always been eager to address the long-standing issue of deforestation in her country. After years of diplomatic efforts, her government finally signed the ""Amazon Rainforest Agreement"" – an international treaty aimed at conserving the world's most precious tropical ecosystems.

Unbeknownst to Sofia, however, her country's actual implementation of the treaty was far from perfect. Loggers and landowners continued to clear-cut forests at alarming rates, despite the country's official commitment to reduce deforestation by 20% within three years.

It was then that the Amazon Rainforest Agreement's Treaty Body stepped in. This independent panel of experts, comprising of conservationists, scientists, and lawyers from multiple countries, reviewed Sofia's government's progress towards meeting its treaty obligations. They received reports from NGOs, indigenous communities, and even analyzed satellite images of the forest cover.

The treaty body assessed the country's efforts and found that it had failed to meet its deforestation targets. They provided guidance on corrective measures, urging Sofia's government to strengthen enforcement of anti-logging laws, invest in sustainable forestry practices, and ensure community involvement in forest management.

Armed with the treaty body's recommendations, Sofia was forced to face the reality of her government's half-hearted efforts. She rallied her colleagues, and together they implemented new laws, subsidized reforestation efforts, and engaged local communities in conservation initiatives. Thanks to the treaty body's scrutiny, Sofia's country made significant strides in protecting its precious rainforests. The Amazon Rainforest Agreement served as a powerful tool in holding governments accountable to their international commitments."
Unaccompanied minor	"An unaccompanied minor (sometimes ""unaccompanied child"" or ""separated child"") is a child without the presence of a legal guardian.
The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child defines unaccompanied minors and unaccompanied children as those ""who have been separated from both parents and other relatives and are not being cared for by an adult who, by law or custom, is responsible for doing so."" The Committee defines separated children as those ""who have been separated from both parents, or from their previous legal or customary primary care-giver, but not necessarily from other relatives. These may, therefore, include children accompanied by other adult family members.""
The number of unaccompanied minors increased drastically from 16,067 to 68,541 during 2011 to 2014."	"Here's a short story illustrating the concept of an unaccompanied minor:

**The Orphaned Son**

As the sun rises over the bustling airport, 12-year-old Carlos stands alone at the baggage carousel, clutching a small backpack and clutching a piece of paper with a ladies' phone number scribbled on it. Just a few days ago, Carlos's mother, Maria, had been a victim of a tragic car accident in Central America. She was on a trip from their home in Honduras to visit her sister in the United States, where she had hoped to start a new life for her and Carlos.

In the chaos after the accident, Maria's sister, who had agreed to meet Maria in the States, was nowhere to be found. Social services in Honduras had been unable to locate any other relatives, and Carlos was left behind, given to a kind social worker who accompanied him to the airport for his flight to meet Maria's sister. However, when they arrived at the arrivals gate, Maria's sister was not there. The social worker had to leave, citing a prior commitment, leaving Carlos alone and bewildered.

As the airport's lost and found staff try to track down Maria's sister, Carlos becomes anxious and scared. He has no one to turn to, no phone number to call, and no way to communicate with his parents. He is now an unaccompanied minor, abandoning his dream of a new life with his mother to face the uncertainty of being alone in a foreign country."
Unconscionability	Unconscionability (sometimes known as unconscionable dealing/conduct in Australia) is a doctrine in contract law that describes terms that are so extremely unjust, or overwhelmingly one-sided in favor of the party who has the superior bargaining power, that they are contrary to good conscience.  Typically, an unconscionable contract is held to be unenforceable because no reasonable or informed person would otherwise agree to it. The perpetrator of the conduct is not allowed to benefit, because the consideration offered is lacking, or is so obviously inadequate, that to enforce the contract would be unfair to the party seeking to escape the contract.	"Here's a story that illustrates unconscionability:

Maria, a Spanish language student, struggled to make ends meet after moving to the United States for college. One day, while living in a small studio apartment, she received a notice from her landlord, Mr. Johnson, terminating her lease in 30 days. Desperate for a place to stay, Maria hastily applied for a new apartment with Mr. Johnson. He presented her with a verbal contract that would tie her to a 2-year lease with an astronomical rent increase the following year. He also included a clause that she would have to pay a surprising and unusually high $5,000 penalty for breaking the lease, regardless of any changes in the market or location of the apartment.

Maria, still feeling the consequence of losing her previous accommodation, signed the contract without fully understanding the penalties. Her student visa job did not cover the life rent hike, and she was forced to put some of her tuition on credit to meet the sky-rocketing financial situation created by Mr. Johnson's lease terms. Six months into the lease, José's senior came down with an emergency and Maria needed to move home for reasons not unprecedented. Mr. Johnson once again demanded Maria pay him $5,000.

A court, in analyzing the situation, found this contract as unconscionable because the terms were far from reasonable considering Maria's purported living conditions. Mr. Johnson refused to renegotiate or make a concession, concerning many to consider the deal to be stacked against her, basically worthwhile only to him."
Unconscionability in English law	"Unconscionability in English law is a field of contract law and the law of trusts, which precludes the enforcement of voluntary (or consensual) obligations unfairly exploiting the unequal power of the consenting parties. ""Inequality of bargaining power"" is another term used to express essentially the same idea for the same area of law, which can in turn be further broken down into cases on duress, undue influence and exploitation of weakness. In these cases, where someone's consent to a bargain was only procured through duress, out of undue influence or under severe external pressure that another person exploited, courts have felt it was unconscionable (i.e., contrary to good conscience) to enforce agreements. Any transfers of goods or money may be claimed back in restitution on the basis of unjust enrichment subject to certain defences.
Considerable controversy is still present over whether ""iniquitous pressure"" must actually be exercised by a defendant in order for a voluntary obligation to be voidable. While it seems clear that in cases of undue influence the pressure need not come from the person who may lose the contract, it is open to debate whether circumstances exist where an obligation should be voidable simply because the person was pressured by circumstances wholly outside a defendant's control.
One of the most prominent cases in this area is Lloyds Bank Ltd v Bundy, where Lord Denning MR advocated that there be a general principle to govern this entire area. He called the concept ""inequality of bargaining power"", while the American case espousing an equivalent doctrine, Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co. (1965), termed the issue one of ""unconscionability"". Note that even though it is accepted that an ""inequality of bargaining power"" is relevant to the doctrine of undue influence, Lord Denning's broader dictum on a general equitable principle of an ""inequality of bargaining power"" was later rejected by the House of Lords in the 1985 case National Westminster Bank plc v Morgan.

"	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of unconscionability in English law:

Maria and her husband, John, are struggling to pay their mortgage after John lost his job. One evening, a friendly loan shark, Jack, arrives at their doorstep, offering to lend them £5,000 to cover the mortgage payments. Maria is desperate and agrees to take the loan, without carefully reading the contract or understanding the interest rate and repayment terms. Jack pressures her to sign the contract immediately, citing that the offer is only available for a few hours and that other lenders are willing to offer a better deal. Maria signs the contract, feeling relieved that their home might be saved.

However, when Maria later reads the fine print, she realizes that the interest rate is exorbitant, and the loan must be repaid in just 30 days. If she defaults, Jack can seize their home. Maria soon realizes that she's trapped in a disastrous contract, and she asks the court to strike it down as unconscionable. The court agrees, recognizing that Maria was under undue influence and that the loan contracts terms were unfairly oppressive. The contract is deemed voidable, and Maria's family is freed from the debt. This case demonstrates how a power imbalance can create an unconscionable contract that the court must disentangle to prevent injustice."
Undue hardship	"An undue hardship is an American and Canadian legal term referring to special or specified circumstances that partially or fully exempt a person or organization from performance of a legal obligation so as to avoid an unreasonable or disproportionate burden or obstacle.
For example, employers are required to provide a reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities, but when an accommodation becomes too taxing on the organization it is classified as an undue hardship and is no longer required.  
These hardships include the nature and cost of the accommodation in relation to the size, resources, nature, and structure of the employer's operation. In the religious exemption context, undue burden is separately defined as anything ""more than de minimus"", as opposed to onerous or costly burdens."	"Emily, a dedicated teacher, had been working at Oakdale Elementary School for over 10 years. She had always been an exemplary employee, earning praises from administrators and students alike. However, after a car accident, Emily suffered a severe back injury that left her with a permanent disability.

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Oakdale Elementary was required to provide a reasonable accommodation to enable Emily to continue working. Emily requested a part-time schedule, which would allow her to take regular breaks to rest and avoid exacerbating her injury.

Initially, the school administration agreed to this accommodation, recognizing that Emily's productivity and morale remained high, and her teaching skills were undeniably valuable. However, after a year, the school's budget constraints and increased student enrollment made it challenging to adjust to the new schedule.

The school administration, facing an undue hardship, informed Emily that, although they valued her contributions, they could no longer accommodate her part-time schedule. Despite this, they offered alternative flexible arrangements, such as telecommuting one day a week or taking shorter breaks. Emily understood the school's position and, after exploring these options, found a compromise that allowed her to continue teaching with some modifications.

In this scenario, the school's initial accommodation, although reasonable, became an undue hardship due to the changing circumstances of the organization. The school's obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation was modified to find an alternative solution that still enabled Emily to work, while also taking into account the school's legitimate concerns."
Undue influence	"Undue influence (UI) is a psychological process by which a person's free will and judgement is supplanted by that of another. It is a legal term and the strict definition varies by jurisdiction. Generally speaking, it is a means by which a person gains control over their victims' decision making through manipulation tactics and unfair pressure, typically for financial gain. Historically, UI has been poorly understood, even in some legal circles.
Undue influence is typically perpetrated by a person who is trusted by the victim and is dependent on them for emotional and physical needs. Caregivers are often found to have unduly influenced their patients, however, anyone in a position of trust and authority over the victim (e.g. fiduciary) may be guilty. This includes the victims' attorney, accountant, nursing home attendant, or even children. UI is a process, not a single event. A manipulator may spend weeks, months, or even years before successfully unduly-influencing their victim. Anyone is susceptible to UI, but the elderly are particularly vulnerable. Perpetrators of UI operate in shadow, enacting their manipulation behind closed doors where there are no witnesses. A person being unduly influenced may become withdrawn, depressive and passive. Physical signs of abuse may include unexplained bruising, scratches, and/or broken bones. Other signs may include missing or broken dentures, prescription eyeglasses, hearing aids or other assistive devices. 
A distinction is made between the nature of capacity and undue influence. In assessing capacity, the practitioner evaluates an individual's ability to competently perform tasks (e.g., execute a will or give medical consent). These assessments give insight to the functioning of the cognitive capabilities at that moment in time. Conversely, screening for undue influence is focused on the process of events which occur over an extended period. To determine whether another person is leveraging unfair tactics on the victim, an assessment specific to undue influence is required. 
Undue influence occurs in various circumstances including, but not limited to domestic violence, hostage situations, cults, prisoners of war, and dictatorships. The common theme among these situations is the aspect of psychological manipulation. Traumatic bonding may occur between the victim and influencer, as a result, the victim may even defend the perpetrator. The effectiveness of cult tactics (e.g. love bombing) on young and healthy individuals illustrates that anyone, regardless of mental status, is a potential victim of UI under certain circumstances.
Elderly Americans are living longer, and with this increased life expectancy, the prevalence of cognitive disorders associated with advanced age has also increased. A significant concentration of wealth is controlled by this aging demographic making them a potential target for exploitation.  Modern families are becoming more complex and dispersed. Given these factors, the number of will contests involving undue influence is expected to increase."	"Meet Emma, a 75-year-old widow who lives alone in a cozy house in a quiet neighborhood. Her granddaughter, Rachel, has been taking care of her for the past five years, helping with grocery shopping, cooking, and managing her medication. Rachel has become Emma's confidante and closest companion, and Emma has come to rely heavily on her.

As Emma's health begins to decline, she starts to struggle with cognitive decline and becomes more reliant on Rachel to handle her daily affairs. Rachel, knowing Emma's vulnerability, starts to subtly manipulate her into making decisions that benefit herself financially. She convinces Emma to change the beneficiaries of her life insurance policy and to add her own name as the primary owner of Emma's bank accounts.

At first, Emma is hesitant, but Rachel's constant reassurance and ""concern"" for Emma's well-being wear her down. Emma starts to feel guilty for questioning Rachel's advice and begins to doubt her own judgment. Rachel's influence over Emma grows, and soon Emma is signing papers without fully understanding their implications.

As Emma's family and friends become suspicious of Rachel's activities, they start to notice changes in Emma's behavior. She becomes withdrawn and isolated, and her usual spark seems to be gone. Her family discovers that Rachel has been hiding financial documents and evidence of Emma's altered will, and they begin to suspect that Rachel has been unduly influencing Emma.

In this scenario, Rachel has leveraged her position of trust and authority to manipulate Emma into making decisions that were not in her best interest. This is a classic case of undue influence, where a caregiver has exploited the vulnerability of an elderly individual to gain control over their assets and decision-making."
Undue influence in English law	"Undue influence in English law is a field of contract law and property law whereby a transaction may be set aside if it was procured by the influence exerted by one person on another, such that the transaction ""ought not fairly to be as treated the expression of [that] person's free will"".
Historically, the doctrine had predominantly been invoked where the person who is exercising undue influence over another person either enters into a contract with the affected person or receives a gift from them. However, much of the recent case law relates to three party cases, where one person (often a husband) exerts undue influence on a second person (the wife) to enter into a transaction (providing a guarantee or security for the husband's debts) with a third party (often a bank).  The doctrine originally developed because of perceived limitations in the law relating to duress. Although the modern law is different, previously in order to set aside a contract for duress it was necessary to show a threat of violence to the person (this is now no longer the case), and the doctrine developed in response to more subtle forms of coercion.  Accordingly, many earlier cases which refer to undue influence are capable of being reconsidered as actually relating to duress or unconscionable bargains in the modern sense.
The leading authority on undue influence is now the decision of the House of Lords in Royal Bank of Scotland v Etridge (No 2), but much of the earlier case law continues to be relevant. There has been no real statutory intervention in this area of the law. Despite the wide array of cases considering the doctrine, there remains some disagreement as to the precise ambit of the doctrine."	"Emma had been married to James for over 20 years, and throughout their relationship, she had always managed their finances. After James's mother's passing, he became desperate to pay off his mother's debts left behind. The bank was threatening to repossess his mother's property, and James was frantically trying to come up with a plan to settle the debt.

Emma, being the careful planner she was, suggested that she guarantee James's debts, ensuring the bank would release the property and allow James to focus on rebuilding his life. James was hesitant at first, but Emma assured him that it was the best way to handle the situation. With Emma's reassurances and her role as the financial manager of their household, James eventually agreed to let Emma handle the negotiations with the bank.

Weeks went by, and Emma negotiated the guarantee with the bank. However, unbeknownst to James, Emma had secretly taken control of his financial affairs, hiding the fact that the bank was asking for joint guarantees and that his property would be at risk if he defaulted on the loan. When James discovered the truth, he was devastated, feeling deceived and manipulated by Emma.

In court, James argued that Emma had exerted undue influence over him, taking advantage of his vulnerability and emotional state to secure the guarantee. The court agreed, ruling that the guarantee was not a genuine expression of James's free will, as Emma had wielded her influence to manipulate him into signing away his assets.

In this case, Emma's undue influence led to the nullification of the guarantee, reflecting the doctrine's purpose in protecting individuals from coercion and unfair influence in their financial dealings."
Uninsured employer	"Uninsured employer in the United States is a term to identify an employer of workers under circumstances where there is no form of insurance in place to provide certain benefits to those workers.  More specifically, it is a term used in workers’ compensation law to identify an employer who does not have some form of worker's compensation insurance or self-insurance coverage in effect at the time of, or during the time of, a claimed injury.
All States require that employers provide injury benefits coverage to their employees. These benefits are called workers’ compensation insurance coverage.  This kind of coverage is to be distinguished from liability coverage, which covers the premises and the owner/occupier of the space from claims made by non-employees for injuries on the premises. It is also to be distinguished from health insurance, which covers only medical bills for non-work incurred conditions.
Protection can be accomplished through a traditional insurance policy for workers’ compensation coverage. Coverage can also be accomplished by way of compliance with various State self-insurance laws (usually reserved for larger employers) requiring substantial bonding and self-funding.  For example, public agencies are usually permissibly self-insured.
When the employer has no specific insurance, or arrangement for the provision of workers’ compensation benefits to injured employees, the employer is then referred to as an uninsured employer."	"As the sun rose over the small town of Willow Creek, a routine morning unfolded at the local construction site. Joe, a skilled carpenter, was hard at work on the new community center. Suddenly, a heavy beam fell, pinning Joe's leg beneath its weight. His coworkers rushed to his aid, calling 911 and stabilizing the beam until medical help arrived.

The emergency room doctor quickly determined that Joe's injury was serious and would require multiple surgeries. As he prepared to treat Joe, the doctor asked about his insurance status. Joe mentioned that his employer, Tom's Construction, didn't have any workers' compensation insurance. The doctor's expression turned grim, explaining that Tom's Construction was an uninsured employer.

Joe was shocked and worried. Without workers' compensation insurance, he might not receive the medical benefits he desperately needed. He realized that Tom, the owner, had been taking risks by avoiding insurance premiums, putting his employees at risk. As Joe underwent treatment, he began to explore his options, researching his rights as an employee of an uninsured employer.

In the end, Joe learned that he might be eligible for state benefits and potentially even file a claim against Tom's Construction for negligence. Though the road ahead would be challenging, Joe determined to fight for his rights and the rights of his fellow workers who might also be affected by the lack of insurance. The incident served as a valuable lesson about the importance of workers' compensation insurance and the consequences of being an uninsured employer."
United States v. American Bell Telephone Co.	United States v. Bell Telephone Co., 167 U.S. 224 (1897), is an 1897 decision of the United States Supreme Court that held that the United States lacked standing to challenge the validity of its issued patents “on the mere ground of error of judgment” in issuing them. The United States had standing to seek to invalidate patents, however, on grounds of fraudulent procurement and also as a defense to a charge of patent infringement. The decision operated for many decades as a bar to government efforts to seek invalidation of patents that it considered spurious until the Supreme Court limited Bell Telephone, first to a limited extent in United States v. United States Gypsum Co., and then more broadly in United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd.	"It was 1895 and Emma, a small business owner, had worked tirelessly to develop a game-changing invention - a revolutionary new hair dryer that used hot air to style hair in minutes. She was granted a patent for her innovative design and began marketing the product.

However, a giant competitor, Albert's Grooming Products, also started selling a similar product claiming it was the first. Emma accused Albert of patent infringement and sought legal recourse in court. The United States government, feeling Emma's patent was essentially invalid and overly broad, initially decided to support her claim against Albert's Grooming Products.

The Supreme Court would ultimately rule in United States v. Bell Telephone Co. that the U.S. government did not have the right to sue based solely on errors in judgment made when granting the patent. In short, the government couldn't argue the patent was a mistake, but could challenge it if, for instance, it was fraudulently obtained."
United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd.	"United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd., 410 U.S. 52 (1973), is a 1973 decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court held that (1) when a patent is directly involved in an antitrust violation, the Government may challenge the validity of the patent; and (2) ordinarily, in patent-antitrust cases, ""[m]andatory selling on specified terms and compulsory patent licensing at reasonable charges are recognized antitrust remedies."""	"It was a busy evening at the local pharmacy, where medications were frequently being prescribed by doctors to patients. Among the shelves stocked with various medicines, one particular medication, called ""Euphorix,"" had gained immense popularity due to its remarkable healing properties. However, the company behind Euphorix, Glaxo Group Ltd., was found to be engaging in antitrust practices to maintain its monopoly over the market.

The company was accused of setting exorbitant prices for Euphorix, restricting its availability, and refusing to licence the rights to other pharmaceutical companies. The government, concerned about the impact on patients and the healthcare system, decided to take action. They charged Glaxo Group Ltd. with antitrust violations and, as part of the lawsuit, also questioned the validity of the patent that protected the Euphorix formula.

In this case, the Supreme Court agreed with the government's stance. They ruled that when a patent is directly involved in an antitrust violation, the government has the right to challenge the validity of that patent. In situations where a patent impedes fair competition and harms the overall market, the court can intervene.

The court also emphasized that, in patent-antitrust cases, certain remedies, such as mandatory selling on specified terms or compulsory patent licensing at reasonable charges, can be considered as recognized antitrust remedies. These remedies aim to promote fair competition and ensure that the public has access to essential medications at affordable prices.

This ruling sent a strong message to companies engaging in antitrust practices, reminding them that their actions would be closely monitored, and where necessary, taken to court."
Universal jurisdiction	"Universal jurisdiction is a legal principle that allows states or international organizations to prosecute individuals for serious crimes, such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, regardless of where the crime was committed and irrespective of the accused's nationality or residence. Rooted in the belief that certain offenses are universally morally reprehensible and that they threaten the international community as a whole, universal jurisdiction holds that such acts are beyond the scope of any single nation's laws. Instead, these crimes are considered to violate norms owed to the global community (erga omnes) and fundamental principles of international law (jus cogens), making them prosecutable in any court that invokes this principle.
While universal jurisdiction has been championed by organizations such as Amnesty International for ensuring that perpetrators of grave crimes find no refuge, it remains controversial. Critics, like former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, argue that it undermines national sovereignty and risks turning judicial proceedings into politically motivated trials. The principle gained prominence following the Nuremberg trials after World War II, which prosecuted Nazi officials for crimes against humanity, even when such acts were legal under German law at the time. Since then, it has been invoked in various international tribunals and national courts to address impunity for crimes committed in conflict zones or under repressive regimes.
Notably, universal jurisdiction has been applied in cases like Israel’s prosecution of Adolf Eichmann in 1961, the trials of Rwandan genocide perpetrators, and the prosecution of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. The establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) further strengthened this concept, though its use remains contentious, often constrained by political considerations and the practical challenges of enforcing extraterritorial justice."	"As the sun set over the bustling streets of Lagos, Nigeria, local authorities received a shocking tip: a Swiss national, Johann Wiese, was in town, suspected of complicity in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Wiese, a former military sniper, had fled to Somalia after the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia issued an arrest warrant for his involvement in the Srebrenica massacre. When DNA analysis confirmed his presence in Lagos, Nigerian officials immediately issued an arrest warrant.

Wiese had thought himself safe in Sweden, where he had lived under a false identity for over a decade. However, Nigeria invoked universal jurisdiction, citing the international community's shared responsibility to prosecute those responsible for crimes against humanity. Even though Wiese had never set foot in Nigeria, the principle of universal jurisdiction allowed the country to prosecute him for his alleged crimes.

The Nigerian government collaborated with international authorities to bring Wiese to justice, carrying out a surveillance operation and eventually apprehending him. As he stood before a Nigerian court, Wiese was charged with the lesser charge of complicity in genocide, tried according to Nigerian law and international standards. Prosecutors presented evidence of Wiese's participation in the Rwandan genocide, drawing from testimonies, records, and forensic evidence collected in other countries.

The verdict shocked human rights organizations worldwide: guilty. Wiese was sentenced to prison time. With this case, Nigeria exercised universal jurisdiction, demonstrating that no state can be seen as a haven for those committing the most heinous crimes."
Valid when made	"Valid when made (also sometimes valid-when-made) is a United States legal doctrine that holds that the terms of a loan, if legally valid when the loan was made, remain valid after the loan is sold or assigned to a third party. Historically, the doctrine has often been applied to loans made by national banks and then transferred to secondary lenders. Under this doctrine, debt buyers may purchase loans from national banks and collect interest at the same rate as the original lender, regardless of the usury laws of the state they operate in.
The doctrine entered common law during the 19th century and was codified in a final rule by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 2020."	"It was a hot summer day in Phoenix, Arizona, and Sarah had just graduated from college with a heavy student loan debt. She had taken out a $20,000 loan from First National Bank at 6% interest, which seemed reasonable at the time. However, after moving to Arizona, she discovered that the state had strict usury laws limiting interest rates to 5% per annum.

Sarah learned that a debt collector, XYZ Corporation, had purchased her loan from First National Bank and was now trying to collect the interest at the 6% rate. Sarah felt ripped off, arguing that the interest rate was illegal under Arizona's usury laws.

That's when she met Attorney Rachel, a consumer protection lawyer who explained the doctrine of ""valid when made"" to her. Rachel explained that when First National Bank made the loan, it was a valid and legal agreement between the bank and Sarah. Even though the loan was later sold to XYZ Corporation, the terms of the loan – including the interest rate – remained the same.

Rachel filed a lawsuit on Sarah's behalf, arguing that the doctrine of ""valid when made"" allowed the original loan terms to stand, even after the loan was assigned to XYZ Corporation. The court ultimately ruled in Sarah's favor, upholding the 6% interest rate. While Sarah wasn't thrilled about paying more interest, she knew that the original loan terms were valid when they were made, and the doctrine of ""valid when made"" protected the lender's rights."
Vicarious liability	"Vicarious liability is a form of a  strict, secondary liability that arises under the common law doctrine of agency, respondeat superior, the responsibility of the superior for the acts of their subordinate or, in a broader sense, the responsibility of any third party that had the ""right, ability, or duty to control"" the activities of a violator. It can be distinguished from contributory liability, another form of secondary liability, which is rooted in the tort theory of enterprise liability because, unlike contributory infringement, knowledge is not an element of vicarious liability. The law has developed the view that some relationships by their nature require the person who engages others to accept responsibility for the wrongdoing of those others. The most important such relationship for practical purposes is that of employer and employee."	"As the owner of a popular coffee shop, Emily relied on her baristas to keep the store running smoothly during busy mornings. One of the baristas, Alex, was prone to reckless behavior, and one day, he spilled a scalding cup of coffee on a customer, causing serious burns.

The customer, Jane, sued the coffee shop for negligence, and the court ruled in her favor. Emily was shocked - she had never seen Alex do anything like this before, and she couldn't understand why she was being held liable.

In court, the judge explained that as Alex's employer, Emily had a legal obligation to ensure that her employees acted responsibly while on the job. Vicarious liability kicked in because Emily had the ""right, ability, or duty to control"" Alex's actions, even though she wasn't directly involved in the incident. By hiring and training Alex, Emily was deemed responsible for his actions, whether she knew about them or not.

The court reasoning made sense: as an employer, Emily had a responsibility to protect her customers from harm caused by her employees. Even if she didn't know about Alex's reckless behavior, she could have taken measures to prevent it from happening, such as providing additional training or supervising him more closely.

The court ruled that Emily was liable for the damages caused by Alex, and she was required to compensate Jane for her injuries. Emily realized that she had a duty not only to her employees but also to her customers, and she made changes to her workplace to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future."
Violation of law	"A wrong or wrength (from Old English wrang – 'crooked') is an act that is illegal or immoral. Legal wrongs are usually quite clearly defined in the law of a state or jurisdiction. They can be divided into civil wrongs and crimes (or criminal offenses) in common law countries, while civil law countries tend to have some additional categories, such as contraventions.
Moral wrong is an underlying concept for legal wrong. Some moral wrongs are punishable by law, for example, rape or murder. Other moral wrongs have nothing to do with law but are related to unethical behaviours. On the other hand, some legal wrongs, such as many types of parking offences, could hardly be classified as moral wrongs."	"As the sun set over the small town of Mapleton, a sense of excitement filled the air. The annual SummerFest was underway, and the streets were buzzing with people enjoying food, music, and games. Amidst the fun, 19-year-old Alex had other plans. He had always been fascinated by street racing and had been eyeing the empty parking lot of the old warehouse on Main Street.

As the night wore on, Alex snuck out of his friend's house and brought his high-performance sports car to the warehouse. He revved the engine, feeling the rush of adrenaline, and began to speed around the lot. The sounds of screeching tires and cheering crowds from the festival nearby masked the noise.

Suddenly, a police car appeared, lights flashing. Officer Johnson, a seasoned veteran of the Mapleton Police Department, had been patrolling the area and received a tip about the suspicious noise. Alex was immediately pulled over and found to be driving 20 miles over the speed limit in a designated quiet zone.

Officer Johnson cited Alex for reckless driving, a violation of the county's traffic laws. The consequences were severe, including a large fine and a possible license suspension. Alex was taken aback, realizing that his thrill-seeking adventure had turned into a serious legal wrong. He had broken the law, putting himself and others at risk, and now had to face the consequences.

In this scenario, Alex's actions, while thoughtless and dangerous, are now legally defined as a wrong. His reckless driving violated the county's traffic laws, illustrating the concept of legal wrongness."
Volenti non fit injuria	"Volenti non fit iniuria (or injuria) (Latin: ""to a willing person, injury is not done"") is a Roman legal maxim and common law doctrine which states that if someone willingly places themselves in a position where harm might result, knowing that some degree of harm might result, they are not able to bring a claim against the other party in tort or delict. Volenti applies only to the risk which a reasonable person would consider them as having assumed by their actions; thus a boxer consents to being hit, and to the injuries that might be expected from being hit, but does not consent to (for example) his opponent striking him with an iron bar, or punching him outside the usual terms of boxing.  Volenti is also known as a ""voluntary assumption of risk"".
Volenti is sometimes described as the plaintiff ""consenting to run a risk"". In this context, volenti can be distinguished from legal consent in that the latter can prevent some torts arising in the first place. For example, consent to a medical procedure prevents the procedure from being a trespass to the person, or consenting to a person visiting one's land prevents them from being a trespasser.

"	"Alice, an avid rock climber, had been waiting for months to tackle the infamous ""Vertigo Wall"" at the local climbing gym. Finally, her friend, a skilled climber, offered to take her on as a beta climber. Alice knew the wall posed significant risks, but she had always wanted to challenge herself and learn from a more experienced climber.

As they began climbing, Alice's friend briefed her on the potential dangers, including ropes that could fail, loose gravel, and steep drops. Alice understood that climbing involved inherent risks and was willing to accept those risks to achieve her goal. She donned her harness, carefully followed the instructions, and trusted her friend to guide her through the climb.

Mid-climb, disaster struck when a fierce gust of wind dislodged a loose rock, hitting Alice on the forehead. She fell from the wall, suffered a minor concussion, and broke her arm. Alice's friend rushed to her side, apologetic and concerned.

As Alice sought medical attention, she began to question whether her friend was liable for her injuries. However, upon reflection, Alice realized she had willingly assumed the risk by choosing to climb the difficult wall and knowing the hazards involved. She understood that her friend had not acted recklessly or without proper precautions.

In court, Alice's case was dismissed due to the application of ""Volenti non fit iniuria"". The judge ruled that Alice's actions – climbing the Vertigo Wall – demonstrated her willing acceptance of the associated risks, including injuries like hers. Alice, though disappointed, acknowledged the importance of taking responsibility for her choices and the primacy of safety protocols in her beloved sport."
Wagoner Doctrine	"The Wagoner Doctrine is an American United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit legal principle applying the longstanding common law in pari delicto (roughly translated ""in equal fault"") rule in the bankruptcy setting.
Though controversial due to its willingness to bar recovery in what is typically considered an equitable proceeding (i.e., bankruptcy) and thus not well accepted in other circuits, Wagoner holds that ""a claim against a third party for defrauding a corporation with the cooperation of corporate management accrues to the creditors, and not to the guilty corporation.""
See in pari delicto for more information."	"Here is a fictional story that illustrates the Wagoner Doctrine:

Meet Sarah, the CEO of a small construction company called Green Earth Builders. Sarah and her company, along with other construction companies and a prominent contractor, had bid on a large government project. The contractor, John, was awarded the contract, but only after Sarah and the other construction companies had ""accidentally"" omitted crucial safety regulations from their bids. Unbeknownst to the government, John's company was actually the mastermind behind the faulty bids, and they had colluded with Sarah and the other CEOs to win the contract.

After the project's construction began, defects and safety hazards started to surface, leading to a major lawsuit. The government filed a complaint against John's company, Green Earth Builders, and the other construction companies, alleging that they had engaged in fraud and misrepresentation. The case eventually landed in bankruptcy court, where the creditors sought to recover losses from the fraud.

The court applied the Wagoner Doctrine, ruling that since Sarah's company had willfully participated in the fraud alongside John's company, the guilt was ""in pari delicto"" - equally shared. As a result, the creditors could not recover damages from Green Earth Builders, as they had essentially become an accessory to John's fraud. The court determined that the loss fell squarely on the shoulders of the fraudulent cooperation between the two companies, rather than allowing the creditors to share in the recovery."
Wahkohtowin	"Wahkohtowin is a Cree word which denotes the interconnected nature of relationships, communities, and natural systems. Its literal meaning is ""kinship"", but it is often used to refer to Cree law, or Cree codes of conduct."	"Wahkohtowin's Roots

In the small Cree community of Mistawasis, the annual Fishing Days were approaching. For generations, the community had respected the rivers, respecting the sacred balance between nature and community. Wahkohtowin was woven into the fabric of daily life, guiding individual actions towards harmony.

Seven-year-old Kiska loved to explore the riverbanks with her grandfather, Walter, a respected elder and traditional fisherman. One summer, a severe drought hit the region, leaving the riverbed exposed and bare. The community gathered to discuss the impact on their traditional way of life.

During the gathering, Kiska asked her grandfather why the river wasn't giving them as many fish as usual. Walter shared the ancient wisdom of Wahkohtowin, explaining that the health of the river was connected to the health of the community. He emphasized that their actions had consequences not only for themselves, but for the land, the animals, and future generations.

As they sat by the river, Kiska noticed a group of younger boys trying to catch fish with nets that damaged the habitat. Walter wisely cautioned them about the long-term effects of their actions, explaining that Wahkohtowin required consideration for the delicate balance of nature.

As the community worked together to find sustainable solutions, Kiska began to grasp the concept of Wahkohtowin. She realized that their actions not only affected themselves, but also the land, the water, and the people around them. This understanding sparked a sense of responsibility and respect within her, guiding her decisions and actions for years to come.

In Mistawasis, Wahkohtowin was more than just a concept – it was a way of life, woven into the very fabric of their community. By embracing this interconnectedness, they ensured a healthy and harmonious relationship between the natural world and their daily lives."
Warranty tolling	"Warranty tolling refers to a legal requirement, in some jurisdictions, that the timeframe provided in a product warranty shall be tolled (paused) to protect the consumer from unfairly being deprived of its protections.
For example, under California Civil Code Sections 1795.6 and 1795.7, tolling occurs when the buyer delivers goods to be repaired or provides notice of the problem, and continues so long as the buyer has not yet received the repaired goods or notice that the repairs are complete."	"Here's a story that illustrates the concept of warranty tolling:

Meet Sarah, a enthusiastic shopper who buys a brand new laptop online from XYZ Tech Inc. The laptop comes with a one-year warranty, which Sarah eagerly signs up for. Amidst her honeymoon phase with her new device, she starts experiencing strange shutdown issues after a few months of use.

Undeterred, Sarah contacts XYZ Tech's customer support, explaining the issue and requesting a repair or replacement. The company apologizes for the inconvenience but asks her to send the laptop to their nearest service center. Sarah scrupulously packages the laptop and sends it off.

What happens next? Sarah waits... and waits... and waits. As the weeks turn into months, she keeps checking in with customer support, only to be told that the repair is still ""in progress."" Meanwhile, her laptop, now several months past the original one-year warranty deadline, remains crippled.

Here's the clincher: under her state's warranty tolling law, Sarah's warranty clock has essentially frozen. As long as she's delivered the goods for repair and hasn't yet received the fixed product or notice that it's complete, her warranty remains in effect, even if it's technically past the original deadline. Frustrated but now informed, Sarah waits patiently, knowing that when her laptop is finally returned, it will be repaired or replaced, and she'll still have the support of her warranty."
Workers' compensation employer defense	"Workers' compensation or workers' comp is a form of insurance providing wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of employment in exchange for mandatory relinquishment of the employee's right to sue his or her employer for the tort of negligence.
The trade-off between assured, limited coverage and lack of recourse outside the worker compensation system is known as ""the compensation bargain.” One of the problems that the compensation bargain solved is the problem of employers becoming insolvent as a result of high damage awards. The system of collective liability was created to prevent that and thus to ensure security of compensation to the workers.
While plans differ among jurisdictions, provision can be made for weekly payments in place of wages (functioning in this case as a form of disability insurance), compensation for economic loss (past and future), reimbursement or payment of medical and like expenses (functioning in this case as a form of health insurance), and benefits payable to the dependents of workers killed during employment.
General damage for pain and suffering and punitive damages for employer negligence are generally not available in workers' compensation plans, and negligence is generally not an issue in the case."	"Here is a short story illustrating the concept of Workers' Compensation Employer Defense:

Maria had been working as a construction crew foreman for Smith Builders for over five years. One day, while on the job, she fell off a scaffolding and suffered a serious back injury. The incident sent her to the hospital for several weeks, and it became clear that she wouldn't be able to return to work for several months.

Maria filed a claim for workers' compensation, which her employer, Smith Builders, accepted. Through the workers' compensation insurance, Maria received a weekly payment that covered her lost wages and helped her cover her medical expenses. This way, she had a steady income while she recovered and didn't have to worry about how she would pay her bills.

In exchange, Maria knew she couldn't sue Smith Builders for her injuries, even though it seemed clear that they had been careless with the scaffolding. The employer, Smith Builders, also couldn't be held liable for negligence, as the workers' compensation system allowed her to bypass the legal system and get the benefits she needed quickly.

Maria's situation was a classic example of ""the compensation bargain."" She gained a predictable and generous coverage for her lost wages and medical expenses, while Smith Builders was protected from a lawsuit over the nature of the scaffolding. For both Maria and Smith Builders, the system provided a safe and practical solution, allowing them to avoid the complexities and unpredictability of a traditional lawsuit."
Wrongdoing	"A wrong or wrength (from Old English wrang – 'crooked') is an act that is illegal or immoral. Legal wrongs are usually quite clearly defined in the law of a state or jurisdiction. They can be divided into civil wrongs and crimes (or criminal offenses) in common law countries, while civil law countries tend to have some additional categories, such as contraventions.

Other moral wrongs have nothing to do with law but are related to unethical behaviours. On the other hand, some legal wrongs, such as many types of parking offences, could hardly be classified as moral wrongs."	"Meet Sarah, a successful marketing executive in her late 20s. She's always been driven to succeed, but her ambition sometimes gets the better of her. One day, she finds out that her colleague, Emily, is being considered for a promotion that Sarah believes she deserves. Frustrated and feeling entitled, Sarah decides to sabotage Emily's chances.

Sarah starts by spreading false rumors about Emily's work quality, and then she fabricates an ""accident"" that causes Emily to miss an important meeting with a potential client. Sarah feels a mix of emotions: guilty, yet relieved that she's one step closer to getting the promotion.

However, Sarah's actions are illegal and unethical. She committed a moral wrong, as she intentionally harmed someone else's reputation and career. This is an example of a legal wrong, specifically a civil wrong. Emily, feeling devastated and betrayed, decides to take Sarah to court for emotional distress and damages.

As Sarah's case progresses, it becomes clear that her actions were not only harmful but also illegal. The court rules in Emily's favor, and Sarah is ordered to pay damages and apologize publicly. Sarah's wrongdoing not only damaged her colleague's reputation but also compromised her own professionalism and integrity.

In this scenario, Sarah's actions illustrate the legal concept of wrongdoing. Her illegal and unethical behavior led to consequences, both personally and professionally. This example shows how wrongdoings can result in legal repercussions and have a significant impact on individuals and their relationships."
